    "abstract": "We present a Bayesian framework that enhances the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) by incorporating informative positional priors from the Euclid galaxy lens catalog. The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information."

    "abstract": "Distributed machine learning systems require strong privacy guarantees, verifiable compliance, and scalable deploy- ment across heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments. This work introduces a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero- knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance powered by reinforcement learning. The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling cryptographically verifiable policy enforcement across institutions and cloud platforms. A full prototype deployed across hybrid Kubernetes clusters demonstrates reduced membership- inference risk, consistent enforcement of formal privacy budgets, and stable model performance under differential privacy. Ex- perimental evaluation across multi-institution workloads shows that the architecture maintains utility with minimal overhead while providing continuous, risk-aware governance. The pro- posed framework establishes a practical foundation for deploying trustworthy and compliant distributed machine learning systems at scale."

In this work, we refined the LAMOST DR10 M-type star catalog through a two-stage process. First, we purified the catalog using techniques including deep learning and color-magnitude diagrams to remove 22,496 non-M spectra, correct 2,078 dwarf/giant classifications, and update 12,900 radial velocities. This resulted in a cleaner catalog containing 870,518 M-type spectra (820,493 dwarfs, 50,025 giants). Second, applying a label transfer strategy using values from APOGEE DR16 for parameter prediction with a ten-fold cross-validated CNN ensemble architecture, we predicted $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [M/H], and [$α$/M] separately for M dwarfs and giants. The average internal errors for M dwarfs/giants are respectively: $T_\\text{eff}$ 30/17 K, log $g$ 0.07/0.07 dex, [M/H] 0.07/0.05 dex, and [$α$/M] 0.02/0.02 dex. Comparison with APOGEE demonstrates external precisions of 34/14 K, 0.12/0.07 dex, 0.09/0.04 dex, and 0.03/0.02 dex for M dwarfs/giants, which represents precision improvements of over 20\\% for M dwarfs and over 50\\% for M giants compared to previous literature results.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies."

We believe that this is a powerful tool in both analytical and numerical calculations. We begin with the differential operator with respect to a function that generates a semigroup. By discretizing this operator, we obtain a matrix approximation. Importantly, this discretization provides not only an approximating operator but also an approximating semigroup. This point motivates our approach, as we then apply Balakrishnan's representations of fractional powers of operators, which are based on semigroups. Using estimates of the semigroup norm and the norm of the difference between the operator and its matrix approximation, we derive the convergence rate for the approximation of the fractional power of operators with the fractional power of correspondings matrix operators. In addition, an explicit formula for calculating an arbitrary power of a two-band matrix is obtained, which is indispensable in the numerical solution of fractional differential and integral equations."

    "abstract": "Hybrid work policy, especially return-to-office requirements, remains a globally salient topic as workers, companies, and governments continue to debate and disagree. Despite extensive discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of remote and hybrid arrangements, the optimal number of remote days that jointly considers multiple organizational outcomes has not been empirically established. Focusing on two critical career outcomes -- turnover risk and promotion -- we examine how remote work frequency shapes employee trajectories using large-scale observational activity data from a company with over one million employees. We find that increased remote-work frequency is associated with an initial decrease and then an increase in turnover, while promotion likelihood initially rises and then declines. Accordingly, we identify approximately two remote days per week as an optimal balance -- maximizing promotion, a positive outcome for employees, while minimizing turnover, which is undesirable for organizations and may indicate negative employee experiences. These patterns vary across subgroups defined by gender, role type, and leadership status. Several notable results emerge. First, male employees derive greater promotion benefits from remote work than female employees. Second, support workers (non-core business roles) do not experience promotion gains, and the reduction in turnover at their optimal remote-work frequency is marginal compared with employees in core business roles. Third, organizational leaders face greater challenges in remote settings than individual contributors: their turnover risk increases substantially at higher remote frequencies, and their likelihood of promotion decreases as remote frequency rises. We further show that time-allocation patterns partly explain how remote-work frequency influences these career outcomes."

    "abstract": "Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction."

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions."

We theoretically derive OCVF as a numerically tractable extension of the \"Constrained-Ensemble Variational Method\" (CEVM), wherein a neural network (ΔH_θ) learns the correction functional required to match the experimental data. We apply OCVF to BaTiO3 (BTO) to validate the framework: a neural network potential trained on DFT data serves as H_o, and experimental PDF data at various temperatures are used as constraints (\\mathfrak{O}{\\text{exp},s}). The final model, H_o + ΔH_θ, successfully predicts the complete phase transition sequence accurately (s', s \\neq s'). Compared to the prior model, the accuracy of the Cubic-Tetragonal (C-T) phase transition temperature is improved by 95.8\\% , and the Orthorhombic-Rhombohedral (O-R) T_c accuracy is improved by 36.1\\%.

To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities."

Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation. To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness."

The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows."

This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics.

Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale.

Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Drift diffusion models (DDMs) have found widespread use in computational neuroscience and other fields. They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary. Furthermore, we conduct numerical examples with an attentional DDM (aDDM) to show that the use of TADA systematically misestimates the effect of attention in decision making."

    "abstract": "Topological spin textures are characterized by topological magnetic charges, Q, which govern their electromagnetic properties. Recent studies have achieved skyrmion bundles with arbitrary integer values of Q, opening possibilities for exploring topological spintronics based on Q. However, the realization of stable skyrmion bundles in chiral magnets at room temperature and zero magnetic field - the prerequisite for realistic device applications - has remained elusive. Here, through the combination of pulsed currents and reversed magnetic fields, we experimentally achieve skyrmion bundles with different integer Q values - reaching a maximum of 24 at above room temperature and zero magnetic field - in the chiral magnet Co8Zn10Mn2. We demonstrate the field-driven annihilation of high-Q bundles and present a phase diagram as a function of temperature and field. Our experimental findings are consistently corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, which reveal the nature of the skyrmion bundle as that of skyrmion tubes encircled by a fractional Hopfion."

    "abstract": "VTuber agencies -- multichannel networks (MCNs) that bundle Virtual YouTubers (VTubers) on YouTube -- curate portfolios of channels and coordinate programming, cross appearances, and branding in the live-streaming VTuber ecosystem. It remains unclear whether affiliation binds fans to a single channel or instead encourages movement within a portfolio that buffers exit, and how these micro level dynamics relate to meso level audience overlap. This study examines how affiliation shapes short horizon viewer trajectories and the organization of audience overlap networks by contrasting agency affiliated and independent VTubers. Using a large, multiyear, fan centered panel of VTuber live stream engagement on YouTube, we construct monthly audience overlap between creators with a similarity measure that is robust to audience size asymmetries. At the micro level, we track retention, changes in the primary creator watched (oshi), and inactivity; at the meso level, we compare structural properties of affiliation specific subgraphs and visualize viewer state transitions. The analysis identifies a pattern of loose mobility: fans tend to remain active while reallocating attention within the same affiliation type, with limited leakage across affiliation type. Network results indicate convergence in global overlap while local neighborhoods within affiliated subgraphs remain persistently denser. Flow diagrams reveal circulate and recapture dynamics that stabilize participation without relying on single channel lock in. We contribute a reusable measurement framework for VTuber live streaming that links micro level trajectories to meso level organization and informs research on creator labor, influencer marketing, and platform governance on video platforms. We do not claim causal effects; the observed regularities are consistent with proximity engineered by VTuber agencies and coordinated recapture."

Its spectrum transitions from a blue to red continuum with clear blueshifted Fe II and Si II broad absorption features, allowing for a SN Ic-BL classification. We do not detect any transient radio emission and rule out the existence of an on-axis, energetic jet $\\gtrsim 10^{50}~$erg.

The disk outflows and magnetar winds power blackbody emission as they cool, producing the first peak in the SN LC. The spin-down luminosity of the magnetar in combination with the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni produces the late-time SN LC.

    "abstract": "As both ML training and inference are increasingly distributed, parallelization techniques that shard (divide) ML model across GPUs of a distributed system, are often deployed. With such techniques, there is a high prevalence of data-dependent communication and computation operations where communication is exposed, leaving as high as 1.7x ideal performance on the table. Prior works harness the fact that ML model state and inputs are already sharded, and employ careful overlap of individual computation/communication shards. While such coarse-grain overlap is promising, in this work, we instead make a case for finer-grain compute-communication overlap which we term FiCCO, where we argue for finer-granularity, one-level deeper overlap than at shard-level, to unlock compute/communication overlap for a wider set of network topologies, finer-grain dataflow and more. We show that FiCCO opens up a wider design space of execution schedules than possible at shard-level alone. At the same time, decomposition of ML operations into smaller operations (done in both shard-based and finer-grain techniques) causes operation-level inefficiency losses. To balance the two, we first present a detailed characterization of these inefficiency losses, then present a design space of FiCCO schedules, and finally overlay the schedules with concomitant inefficiency signatures. Doing so helps us design heuristics that frameworks and runtimes can harness to select bespoke FiCCO schedules based on the nature of underlying ML operations. Finally, to further minimize contention inefficiencies inherent with operation overlap, we offload communication to GPU DMA engines. We evaluate several scenarios from realistic ML deployments and demonstrate that our proposed bespoke schedules deliver up to 1.6x speedup and our heuristics provide accurate guidance in 81% of unseen scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches."

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks."

Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$α$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei."

FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \\emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \\textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead."

But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design. Our setup tests the localization step with minimal context to the extent that the task should be logically impossible to solve. Our results show the risk of relying on older popular benchmarks and support the shift toward newer datasets built with contamination in mind."

We present an integrated, adaptive, and scalable system that autonomously detects and interrogates plant sensors using a coordinated suite of low-cost optical components including a LiDAR, liquid lens, monochrome camera, filter wheel, and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM). The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements. We validated the system in controlled indoor experiments, demonstrating accurate detection and tracking of reflective plant sensors and successful acquisition of their spectral data. To our knowledge, no other system currently integrates these sensing and optical modalities for agricultural monitoring. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, low-cost, and automated plant sensor interrogation, representing a significant step toward scalable, real-time plant health monitoring in precision agriculture."

This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively.

    "abstract": "The exploration of topological phase transition (TPT) mechanisms constitutes a central theme in quantum materials research. Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs."

Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources."

Existing protections, such as digital watermarking, are largely passive; they provide only post-hoc ownership verification and cannot actively prevent the illicit use of a stolen model. This work proposes a proactive protection scheme, dubbed ``Authority Backdoor,\" which embeds access constraints directly into the model. In particular, the scheme utilizes a backdoor learning framework to intrinsically lock a model's utility, such that it performs normally only in the presence of a specific trigger (e.g., a hardware fingerprint). But in its absence, the DNN's performance degrades to be useless. To further enhance the security of the proposed authority scheme, the certifiable robustness is integrated to prevent an adaptive attacker from removing the implanted backdoor. The resulting framework establishes a secure authority mechanism for DNNs, combining access control with certifiable robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on diverse architectures and datasets validate the effectiveness and certifiable robustness of the proposed framework."

To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval."

    "abstract": "Most skydiving accidents occur during the parafoil-piloting and landing stages and result from human lapses in judgment while piloting the parafoil. Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\\%-80\\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights."

Relative to a single free queue, I show that willingness to adopt the priority system is determined solely by income, regardless of service valuation. High-income individuals benefit from the fast-track access, while low-income individuals are worse off and remain in the free line. Middle-income individuals weakly prefer the single free queue; yet, under the priority regime, they pay for fast-track access. Thus, the use of the priority queue does not reveal preferences for the priority system."

We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones."

    "abstract": "A chloroplast is a subcellular organelle of photosynthesis in plant and algal cells. A chloroplast genome encodes proteins of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and ribosomal proteins required to express them. Chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic proteins are mostly intrinsic to the chloroplast thylakoid membrane where they drive vectorial electron and proton transport. There they function in close contact with proteins whose precursors are encoded in the cell nucleus for cytosolic synthesis, subsequent processing, and import into the chloroplast. The protein complexes of photosynthetic electron transport thus contain subunits with one of two quite different sites of synthesis. If most chloroplast proteins result from expression of nuclear genes then why not all? What selective pressure accounts for the persistence of the chloroplast genome? One proposal is that photosynthetic electron transport itself governs expression of genes for its own components: co-location of chloroplast genes with their gene products allows redox regulation of gene expression, thereby resulting in self-adjustment of protein stoichiometry in response to environmental change. This hypothesis posits Co-Location for Redox Regulation, termed CoRR, as the primary reason for the retention of genomes in both photosynthetic chloroplasts and respiring mitochondria. I propose that redox regulation affects all stages of chloroplast gene expression and that this integrated control is mediated by a chloroplast mesosome or nucleoid - a structure that tethers chloroplast DNA to the thylakoid."

    "abstract": "Hybrid systems are an important concept in Cyber-Physical Systems modeling, for which multiphysics modeling from first principles and the reuse of models from libraries are key. To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user."

    "abstract": "Many real-world infrastructures, from sensor and road networks to power grids, are spatially embedded and anisotropic, with constraints on the maximum number of links each node can establish. Such systems can be represented as anisotropic limited-degree networks, in which each node forms at most q outgoing links preferentially oriented along a fixed direction. By increasing the node density sigma at fixed q, we uncover a reentrant percolation transition: a giant strongly connected component emerges, but unexpectedly disintegrates again at high densities. This counterintuitive behavior implies that adding nodes, normally expected to enhance robustness, can instead reduce mutual accessibility and weaken global connectivity. The critical behavior displays two coexisting \"faces\": random-percolation scaling along the preferred direction and directed-percolation scaling transversely, therefore we name this phenomenon Janus percolation, in analogy with the dual-faced Roman god. These findings demonstrate that anisotropy and degree limitation can jointly induce a novel reentrant connectivity with mixed universality that bridges the universality classes of random and directed percolation, providing fresh insight into how structural constraints shape connectivity and resilience in spatial networks."

Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\\approx$0.1 and z$\\approx$0.06, respectively."

NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis."

We show that in these cases the limiting local power functions are the same for the different resampling schemes. We also show that certain naive bootstrap schemes do not work. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the framework to several examples: independence tests, tests on the coefficients in linear regression models, goodness-of-fit tests for general parametric models and for semi-parametric copula models. Simulation results confirm the asymptotic results and suggest that in smaller samples non-traditional bootstrap schemes may have advantages. This bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework is implemented in the R package BootstrapTests."

We derive a necessary criterion under which remembering the measurement outcomes provides better precision in comparison to the outcome-forgotten strategy. Furthermore, we establish a necessary and sufficient criterion for the simultaneous estimation of two parameters encoded by an arbitrary quantum process, including those involving measurements, using qubit probes, and find when the quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound is valid and achievable. For simultaneous estimation of two parameters characterizing the measurement, we find that the achievable quantum Cramér$-$Rao bound can be a valid precision bound only when the measurement direction depends on the parameters of interest."

NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events. The payload is currently scheduled for launch in Q2 2026. This paper presents the NUTEx instrument design, outlines its scientific goals and capabilities, and provides an overview of the electronics and mechanical subsystems, including structural analysis."

We show that the simple protocol where Alice solely communicates a lexicographically-first maximum matching of their edges to Bob is surprisingly powerful: We prove that it yields a $3/4$-approximation in expectation and that our analysis is tight. The semi-robust setting is at least as hard as the fully robust setting. In this setting, all edges of the input graph are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob, and the state-of-the-art result is a fairly involved $5/6$-approximation protocol that is based on the computation of edge-degree constrained subgraphs [Azarmehr, Behnezhad, ICALP'23]. Our protocol also immediately yields a $3/4$-approximation in the fully robust setting. One may wonder whether an improved analysis of our protocol in the fully robust setting is possible: While we cannot rule this out, we give an instance where our protocol only achieves a $0.832 < 5/6 = 0.83$-approximation. Hence, while our simple protocol performs surprisingly well, it cannot be used to improve over the state-of-the-art in the fully robust setting."

We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade. The gravitational wave signal exhibits bursts, akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes, with increasing amplitude towards black hole formation."

While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\\sim$ 10 $\\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \\ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \\ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs."

This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the interplay of rounding objective coefficients in binary programs and almost symmetries. Empirically, reducing the number of significant bits through rounding often leads to instances that are easier to solve. One reason can be that the amount of symmetries increases, which enables solvers to be more effective when they are exploited. This can signify that the original instance contains 'almost symmetries'. Furthermore, solving the rounded problems provides approximations to the original objective values. We empirically investigate these relations on instances of the capacitated facility location problem, the knapsack problem and a diverse collection of additional instances, using the solvers SCIP and CP-SAT. For all investigated problem classes, we show empirically that this yields faster algorithms with guaranteed solution quality. The influence of symmetry depends on the instance type and solver."

We also obtain lower bounds for the inaccuracy measure and compare them with each other. In addition, we introduce a discrimination measure based on varextropy and employ it both for comparing probability distributions and for assessing the goodness of fit of distributions to data and we compare this measure with the dispersion index derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence given in Balakrishnan et al.

    "abstract": "The theoretical landscape of transportation cost planning is shifting from deterministic linear models to dynamic, data-driven optimization. As supply chains face volatility, static 20th-century cost assumptions prove increasingly inadequate. Despite rapid technological advancements, a unified framework linking economic production theory with the operational realities of autonomous, sustainable logistics remains absent. Existing models fail to address non-linear stepwise costs and real-time stochastic variables introduced by market dynamics. This study reconstructs transportation cost planning theory by synthesizing Grand, Middle-Range, and Applied theories. It aims to integrate stepwise cost functions, AI-driven decision-making, and environmental externalities into a cohesive planning model. A systematic theoretical synthesis was conducted using 28 high-impact papers published primarily between 2018 and 2025, employing multi-layered analysis to reconstruct cost drivers. The study identifies three critical shifts: the transition from linear to stepwise fixed costs, the necessity of AI-driven dynamic pricing for revenue optimization, and the role of Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) in minimizing long-term marginal costs. A \"Dynamic-Sustainable Cost Planning Theory\" is proposed, arguing that cost efficiency now depends on algorithmic prediction and autonomous fleet utilization rather than simple distance minimization."

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow."

Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution."

Our procedure is based on a new high-dimensional Gaussian approximation result for the uniform approximation of P-values across time and different coordinates.

    "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement is central to the efficient solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) via the finite element method (FEM). Classical $r$-adaptivity optimizes vertex positions but requires solving expensive auxiliary PDEs such as the Monge-Ampère equation, while classical $h$-adaptivity modifies topology through element subdivision but suffers from expensive error indicator computation and is constrained by isotropic refinement patterns that impose accuracy ceilings. Combined $hr$-adaptive techniques naturally outperform single-modality approaches, yet inherit both computational bottlenecks and the restricted cost-accuracy trade-off. Emerging machine learning methods for adaptive mesh refinement seek to overcome these limitations, but existing approaches address $h$-adaptivity or $r$-adaptivity in isolation. We present HypeR, a deep reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes mesh relocation and refinement. HypeR casts the joint adaptation problem using tools from hypergraph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Refinement is formulated as a heterogeneous multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) where element agents decide discrete refinement actions, while relocation follows an anisotropic diffusion-based policy on vertex agents with provable prevention of mesh tangling. The reward function combines local and global error reduction to promote general accuracy. Across benchmark PDEs, HypeR reduces approximation error by up to 6--10$\\times$ versus state-of-art $h$-adaptive baselines at comparable element counts, breaking through the uniform refinement accuracy ceiling that constrains subdivision-only methods. The framework produces meshes with improved shape metrics and alignment to solution anisotropy, demonstrating that jointly learned $hr$-adaptivity strategies can substantially enhance the capabilities of automated mesh generation."

In this research, we conduct a detailed first-principles study of pure monolayer Fe3O4 and its modification through Zr adsorption at two sites: on top of an Fe atom and at the bridge between Fe atoms. Using spin-polarized density functional theory with the GGA plus U method, we examine how adsorption affects structure, electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. The original monolayer shows half-metallicity, strong spin polarization, and a moderate in-plane piezoelectric effect. Zr adsorption causes local lattice distortions and orbital hybridization, resulting in intermediate electronic states, a reduced bandgap, and increased optical absorption in both spin channels. Notably, Zr at the bridge site greatly enhances dielectric response, optical conductivity, and piezoelectric coefficients, tripling e11 compared to the pristine layer. Elastic constants indicate mechanical softening after functionalization, and energy loss spectra display shifts in plasmon resonance. These findings suggest Zr adsorption offers a controllable, non-destructive way to tune spin, charge, and lattice interactions in Fe4O4 monolayers, connecting magnetic, optical, and piezoelectric functionalities within a single 2D material platform."

However, existing ML applications in seismic liquefaction prediction remain fragmented: sampling strategies vary widely across studies without a unified benchmark. Moreover, these studies generally optimize the sample set configuration independently, ignoring the interaction among training set configurations. To address these limitations, this study establishes a benchmark that systematically evaluates sampling methods, training set sample sizes, train-test split ratios, class distributions, and training set configurations coupling on seven mainstream ML models performance, and further improves the predictive accuracy of seismic liquefaction-using a database of 250 historical liquefaction events, evaluated by Acc and F1. The results show that ordered systematic sampling yields the best performance across all models. The optimal model can be trained when the training set sample size is 200, the train-test split ratio is 80:20, and the class distribution range is 1-1.5. Among them, the train-test split ratio most significantly influenced performance, followed by the class distribution, with the training set sample size having the least effect. Furthermore, the Random Forest model achieves the highest performance, while the K-Nearest Neighbor model performs the weakest. Importantly, this study systematically identifies and verifies for the first time that there will be an interaction effect among training set configurations, rather than a simple additive effect. This study provides a benchmark for scholars to select the optimal sampling method and training set configurations to obtain high accuracy in ML-based liquefaction prediction."

Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \\SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \\SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \\SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \\ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines.

Internet of Things and Cloud computing integrated systems (IoT-Cloud) facilitate sensing, automation, and processing for these healthcare applications. While real-time response is crucial for alleviating patient emergencies, protecting patient privacy is extremely important in data-driven healthcare. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer IoT, Edge and Cloud architecture to enhance the speed of response for emergency healthcare by distributing tasks based on response criticality and permanence of storage. Privacy of patient data is assured by proposing a Differential Privacy framework across several machine learning models such as K-means, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We establish a comprehensive threat model identifying three adversary classes and evaluate Laplace, Gaussian, and hybrid noise mechanisms across varying privacy budgets, with supervised algorithms achieving up to 86% accuracy. The proposed hybrid Laplace-Gaussian noise mechanism with adaptive budget allocation provides a balanced approach, offering moderate tails and better privacy-utility trade-offs for both low and high dimension datasets. At the practical threshold of $\\varepsilon = 5.0$, supervised algorithms achieve 82-84% accuracy while reducing attribute inference attacks by up to 18% and data reconstruction correlation by 70%. Blockchain security further ensures trusted communication through time-stamping, traceability, and immutability for analytics applications.

However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform. Evaluations on Alibaba Cloud show reductions in repair time of up to 41% for single-node failures and 26% for two-node failures."

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities."

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision.

Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability. These results highlight the importance of explicitly encoding domain-specific structural priors into optimization models for resilient decision-making in complex agricultural systems."

RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications."

    "abstract": "LLM-agent based binary code analysis has demonstrated significant potential across a wide range of software security scenarios, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, etc. In agent workflow, however, retrieving the positive from thousands of stripped binary functions based on user query remains under-studied and challenging, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes it from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters."

    "abstract": "Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression."

The goal is to investigate the connection between galaxy sizes with SFH, stellar age, and metallicity. SFHs were derived with Prospector by fitting the high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 together with the broadband photometry from the UltraVISTA catalog. Galaxy sizes were measured by fitting a 2D S{é}rsic profile to the HST ACS~F814W images. We find diverse SFHs and quenching timescales ($τ_\\rm{q}$). The main quiescent population quenched over $τ_\\rm{q}=1.23\\pm0.04$ Gyr, whereas compact post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) quenched much faster, $τ_\\rm{q}=0.13\\pm0.03$ Gyr. At fixed stellar mass, smaller quiescent galaxies quenched more rapidly than larger ones; at fixed size, the dependence on stellar mass is weak. Larger quiescent galaxies are marginally younger, quenched more slowly, and have near-solar metallicities, while compact quiescent galaxies are older, metal-rich, and quenched faster. PSBs formed half their mass later ($z_\\rm{form}\\sim1.9$) and quenched on the shortest timescales. The general trends with galaxy size, $Z_\\star$, and $z_\\rm{form}$ for the quiescent populations remain consistent regardless of the method used to derive the stellar properties. We conclude that compact quiescent galaxies are consistent with both early, moderately fast quenching and with more rapid, late quenching. While this may suggest the existence of multiple quenching channels, our data are also compatible with a continuous distribution of quenching timescales. These findings suggest that different physical mechanisms may drive quenching across galaxy populations, potentially leading to similar morphological outcomes despite differing evolutionary histories."

For practical applications, the reconstruction targets must be measured on the same fixed receiver array used to record the local room impulse responses (RIRs) from the loudspeaker array to the control points in each PSZ, which makes the system inconvenient and costly for real-world use. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for PSZ reproduction with flexible control microphone grid and alternative reproduction target is presented, utilizing the virtual target scene as inputs and the PSZ pre-filters as output. Experimental results of the proposed method are compared with the traditional method, demonstrating that the proposed method is able to handle varied reproduction targets on flexible control point grid using only one training session. Furthermore, the proposed method also demonstrates the capability to learn global spatial information from sparse sampling points distributed in PSZs."

This reveals a fundamental structural advantage of temporal dynamics and highlights a novel mechanism through which switching can overcome classical obstructions to herdability. To validate these conclusions, we utilize a more relaxed form of sign matching within each snapshot of the temporal network. Furthermore, we show that when all snapshots share the same underlying topology, the temporally switching network achieves $\\mathcal{SS}$ herdability within just two snapshots, which is fewer than the number required for structural controllability. Several examples are included to demonstrate these results."

Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs. We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date."

Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state."

Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We fine-tune several open-source LLMs for three tasks: (i) classifying superconductors vs. non-superconductors, (ii) predicting the superconducting transition temperature directly from composition or structure-informed inputs, and (iii) inverse design of candidate compositions conditioned on target Tc. The fine-tuned LLMs achieve performance comparable to traditional feature-based models and in some cases exceed them, while substantially outperforming their base versions and capturing meaningful chemical and structural trends. The inverse-design model generates chemically plausible compositions, including 28% novel candidates not seen in training. Finally, applying the trained predictors to the GNoME database identifies unreported materials with predicted Tc > 10 K. Although unverified, these candidates illustrate how integrating an LLM-driven workflow can enable scalable hypothesis generation for superconductivity discovery."

On the signal processing side, we propose a segmentation procedure based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with the detection of a central extremum, which isolates single spindle events and yields a collection of oscillatory atoms. This construction enables a systematic statistical analysis of spindle features: we derive empirical laws for the distributions of amplitudes, inter-spindle intervals, and rise/decay durations, and show that these exhibit exponential tails consistent with the underlying OU dynamics. We further extend the model to a pair of weakly coupled OU processes with distinct natural frequencies, generating a stochastic mixture of slow, fast, and mixed spindles in random temporal order. The resulting framework provides a data- driven framework for the analysis of transient oscillations in EEG and, more generally, in nonstationary time series."

By assuming a local Lipschitz condition, we derive nonasymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates measured by the gradient of the Moreau envelope. Furthermore, convergence rates in terms of the distance to the optimal solution set are obtained under an additional quadratic growth condition on the objective function.

    "abstract": "While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility."

However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar system at $z=2.67$, identified based on its astrometric measurements from the {\\em Gaia} mission, as well as a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars.

We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\\rm h} = (2.78 \\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization.

This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds. We also formalise and analyse two different variants of the original problem that address the possibility of increasing the number of input biases or the number of functions implemented by the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory. The obtained results can be used as a framework for randomness manipulation via such an approach."

In this Letter, we develop a second-order reduction for a broad class of time-delayed Kuramoto-Daido networks, transforming the original delayed system of one-dimensional phase oscillators into a delay-free network of two-dimensional rotators. The resulting model shows that coupling delay generates inertial terms in the intrinsic dynamics and higher-order (triadic) interactions, and it accurately predicts the emergence of complex collective patterns such as splay, cyclops, and chimera states. The reduction further reveals a qualitative division of roles: time delay acts primarily as effective inertia for higher-dimensional dynamics, including splay states, whereas the induced triadic interactions are decisive for lower-dimensional patterns such as chimeras. The method applies to networks with arbitrary topology, higher-harmonic coupling, and intrinsic-frequency heterogeneity, yielding a compact, parameter-explicit reduced model. This universal reduced description of time-delayed oscillator networks opens the door to systematic prediction and analysis of nontrivial collective dynamics in delay-coupled systems."

Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out OPV-Bench, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2% to 73.3% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales."

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias."

In particular, adding the second delayed-feedback loop allows speeding up both deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation, achieving stabilization of propagating fronts at lower noise intensity and preventing fronts from noise-induced destruction occurring in the presence of single delayed-feedback. All the revealed effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence."

However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main."

However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Existing spherical operators rely on rotational equivariance but often lack the flexibility for real-world complexity. We propose a general operator-design framework based on the designable spherical Green's function and its harmonic expansion, establishing a solid operator-theoretic foundation for spherical learning. Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation. Evaluations on diffusion MRI, shallow water dynamics, and global weather forecasting, GSNO and GSHNet consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our results position GSNO as a principled and general framework for spherical operator learning, bridging rigorous theory with real-world complexity."

We base the model construction on vectors of completely random measures and a latent Markov process for the time-evolving node affiliations. This construction provides a flexible and interpretable approach to model dynamic communities, naturally generalizing existing overlapping block models to the sparse and scale-free regimes. We provide the asymptotic properties of the model concerning sparsity and power-law behavior and propose inference through an approximate procedure which we validate empirically.

    "abstract": "Atom tracing is essential for understanding the fate of labeled atoms in biochemical reaction networks, yet existing computational methods either simplify label correlations or suffer from combinatorial explosion. We introduce a saturation-based framework for enumerating labeling patterns that directly operates on atom-atom maps without requiring flux data or experimental measurements. The approach models reaction semantics using Kleisli morphisms in the powerset monad, allowing for compositional propagation of atom provenance through reaction networks. By iteratively saturating all possible educt combinations of reaction rules, the method exhaustively enumerates labeled molecular configurations, including multiplicities and reuse. Allowing arbitrary initial labeling patterns - including identical or distinct labels - the method expands only isotopomers reachable from these inputs, keeping the configuration space as small as necessary and avoids the full combinatorial growth characteristic of previous approaches. In principle, even every atom could carry a distinct identifier (e.g., tracing all carbon atoms individually), illustrating the generality of the framework beyond practical experimental limitations. The resulting template instance hypergraph captures the complete flow of atoms between compounds and supports projections tailored to experimental targets. Customizable labeling sets significantly reduce generated network sizes, providing efficient and exact atom traces focused on specific compounds or available isotopes. Applications to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glycolytic pathways demonstrate that the method fully automatically reproduces known labeling patterns and discovers steady-state labeling behavior. The framework offers a scalable, mechanistically transparent, and generalizable foundation for isotopomer modeling and experiment design."

Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%.

Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases. Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01).

    "abstract": "Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments."

    "abstract": "Much of today's sustainability discourse emphasizes efficiency, clean technologies, and smart systems, but largely underestimates fundamental physical constraints relating to energy-matter interactions. These constraints stem from the fact that Earth is a materially closed yet energetically open system, driven by the sustained but low power-density flux of solar radiation. This Perspective reframes sustainability within these axiomatic limits, integrating relevant timescales and orders of magnitude. We argue that fossil-fueled industrial metabolism is inherently incompatible with long-term viability, while post-fossil systems are surface-, materials-, and power-intensive. Long-term sustainability must therefore be defined not only by how much energy or material is used, but also by how it is used: favoring organic, carbon-based chemistry with limited reliance on purified metals, operating at low power density, and maintaining low throughput rates. Achieving this requires radical technological shifts toward life-compatible systems and biogeochemical circular processes, and, likely as a consequence, a paradigm change toward degrowth to a steady-state. These two shifts are mutually reinforcing and together provide the necessary foundation for any viable future."

Therefore, monitoring the real-time muon flux is crucial to guide the development of alternative error-correction or protection strategies. We present the design, simulation, and first operation of a cryogenic muon-tagging system based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for integration with superconducting quantum processors. The system consists of two KIDs arranged in a vertical stack and operated at ~20 mK. Monte Carlo simulations based on Geant4 guided the prototype design and provided reference expectations for muon-tagging efficiency and accidental coincidences due to ambient $γ$-rays. We measured a muon-induced coincidence rate among the top and bottom detectors of (192 $\\pm$ 9) $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ events/s, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo prediction. The prototype achieves a muon-tagging efficiency of about 90% with negligible dead time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating a muon-tagging system at millikelvin temperatures and open the path toward its integration with multi-qubit chips to veto or correct muon-induced errors in real time."

In this work, we overcome this challenge in the terahertz domain using an on-chip gradient waveguide array. The key is to spectrally disperse the pulse into spatially separated channels within a lithium niobate chip, effectively decoupling the design of temporal and spectral properties. We validate the source by distinguishing amino acid mixtures, demonstrating its tailored biosensing potential. This work establishes a novel mechanism for integrated THz generation, offering considerable promise for broadband spectroscopy and on-chip photonics."

    "abstract": "A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI."

Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects. TriDF provides a unified framework for understanding the interaction between detection accuracy, evidence identification, and explanation reliability, offering a foundation for building trustworthy systems that address real-world synthetic media threats."

    "abstract": "Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies."

The Kalman controllability in this algebraic language is translated as the freeness of the system module. Linear quadratic regulators rely on quadratic Lagrangians, or cost functions. Any flat output, i.e., any basis of the corresponding free module leads to an open-loop control strategy via an Euler-Lagrange equation, which becomes here a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which is known to exhibit excellent performance concerning model mismatches and disturbances."

These agreements, which are widespread in commercial aviation as a response to highly competitive environments, have enabled the expansion of airline networks without additional costs or risks for the companies involved. The literature presents ambiguous effects associated with the practice, with evidence of increased supply and reduced prices in situations of route complementarity, while also pointing to anti-competitive impacts in markets where companies act as competitors. A review of scientific production over time, including theoretical contributions and case studies, is essential to understand the evolution of these agreements and their implications, especially in the Brazilian context, marked by its own characteristics and particular regulatory history. Thus, this article reviews the literature on codesharing, with an emphasis on the Brazilian market, and uses the Litmaps computational tool, based on artificial intelligence techniques, to support the contextual analysis of publications through their citation relationships. The ultimate goal is to identify and evaluate the main evidence accumulated over decades on the effects of these agreements in Brazil. The joint analysis of the contributions allows us to outline the current state of knowledge, characterize specificities observed in the Brazilian market, and identify gaps that may guide future studies."

While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions."

In free-standing ferroic thin films, where elastic interactions are highly thickness dependent, understanding DW behaviour across length scales and external stimuli is crucial. A thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in elastic DW behaviour has been reported; however, how temperature influences this regime remains unexplored. Here, LaAlO3 thin films spanning the dipolar ($<200$ nm) and crossover (200-300 nm) regimes are investigated using in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach. By tracking DW curvature and density from above $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\\circ$C) to room temperature (RT), a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness is identified. In the dipolar regime, DWs are mobile and curved near $T_C$ and gradually freeze upon cooling, consistent with the well-known temperature freezing regime. In contrast, within the crossover regime, DWs are nearly static, with minimal reconfiguration through cooling and curvature an order of magnitude lower at RT. These results map the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics, and providing insight relevant for domain engineering in free-standing oxide thin films."

The projections of Brownian motions on $V$ with drifts are also Feller diffusions on $C$, and their transition densities and their generators can be again described via these Bessel functions. These processes are called Bessel processes with drifts. In this paper we construct these Bessel processes processes with drift for arbitrary root systems and parameters $k\\ge 0$. Moreover, this construction works also for Dunkl processes. We study some features of these processes with drift like their radial parts, a Girsanov theorem, moments and associated martingales, strong laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems."

Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.

    "abstract": "Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm."

    "abstract": "The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows."

We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \\mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics."

Using the dictionary the smeared correlator factorizes to a flat-space like scattering amplitude about the interior event. Our transformed correlators describe local physics in the two-sided black hole interior, while incurring a suppression of $\\mathcal{O}(e^{-βω/ 2})$. These measurements necessitate a non-trivial time ordering of operators living on boundary hyperboloids which are causally connected to the past light cone of the bulk point, as well as on a corresponding future branch."

Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque.

    "abstract": "The effective field theory (EFT) concept provides a necessary tool for obtaining general predictions of low-energy theory valid below its unitarity-breaking scale (cutoff scale). Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $φF_{μν} F^{μν}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{μνλρ}F^{μν} F^{λρ}$ operator. It may lead to the dominant contribution at high momenta if the EFT cutoff is lower than the Planck mass. Assuming the general consequences of the unitarity and causality constraints, which imply that all EFT operators should be present, and be suppressed by the scales following from the dimension analysis, we obtain the observational constraints (CMB bound for the dark radiation) on the mass of the inflaton and UV cutoff of gravity. We find that for the typical parameters of large field inflation models, the gravitational cutoff scale cannot be lower than $10^{15}$ GeV."

Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released."

    "abstract": "Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) that simultaneously host fully compensated ferrimagnetism are highly sought for energy-efficient and stray-field-free spintronic technologies, yet their realization in chemically disordered systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder. Our results identify Cr3Al as the first experimentally verified A2-disordered Heusler alloy exhibiting both fully compensated ferrimagnetism and spin-gapless semiconducting transport, positioning it as a robust and disorder-tolerant platform for next-generation, high-temperature spintronic devices."

The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states."

    "abstract": "The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\\pm$ 1.0 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\\pm$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time."

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment."

As the quark mass increases, the $N^*(920)$ pole gradually approaches the real axis in the complex $w$-plane (where $w=\\sqrt{s}$). Eventually, in the $O(p^2)$ case, it crosses the $u$-cut on the real axis and enters the adjacent Riemann sheet when the pion mass reaches $526~{\\rm MeV}$. At order $O(p^3)$, the rate at which it approaches the real axis slows down; however, we argue that it will ultimately cross the $u$-cut and enter the adjacent Riemann sheet as well.

    "abstract": "The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures."

Atomistic simulations indicate that such ordering leads to an electric potential difference $χ$, the surface potential, of about $-0.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$ across the first few molecular layers. Here, we calculate surface potentials at interfaces between a simple model fluids and a solid, with Molecular Dynamics simulations. The fluids are made up of either diatomic, dipolar molecules or a single Lennard-Jones particle with a dipole moment. All fluids show some structuring near the interface, but charge oscillations and a non-zero surface potential are present only for asymmetric molecules (unequal diameters of the atoms) or molecules with an off-center dipole. We condense this finding into the criterion that the geometric and dipolar centers of a molecule must differ for the fluid to exhibit a surface potential. Remarkably, while the solid--fluid interaction strength strongly affects the magnitude of charge oscillations, it hardly affects the potential drop $χ$. Further, our results demonstrate that changing the diameter of the smaller atom can flip the sign of the surface potential, thus highlighting the importance of steric effects."

The event was originally identified with moderate significance by matched-filter searches that employ non-eccentric templates. The neglect of relevant physical effects, such as orbital eccentricity, can severely reduce the sensitivity of the search and, consequently, also the significance of an event candidate. Here, we present a targeted eccentric search for GW200105. The eccentric search identifies GW200105 as the most significant event with a signal-to-noise ratio of $13.4$ and a false alarm rate of less than 1 in 1000 years. The best-matching template parameters are consistent with the Bayesian inference result, supporting the interpretation of GW200105 as an NSBH that formed through dynamical mechanisms and not isolated binary evolution."

Through variational analysis, we further demonstrate the optimality of our schedule for systems with linear gap and the partial optimality for general systems, while we also rigorously show that the commonly used linear schedule is never optimal."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

Using put-call parity, we extract zero-coupon bond implied yield curves from S&P 500 index options and compare them with the US daily treasury par yield curves. As the implied yield curves contain maturity time T and strike price K as independent variables, we investigate the K-dependence of the implied yield curve. Our findings, that at-the-money, option-implied yield curves provide the closest match to treasury par yield curves, support the view that the equity options market contains information that is highly relevant for the TSIR. By insisting that the risk-neutral measure used for bond valuation is the same as that revealed by equity derivatives, we offer a new organizing principle for future TSIR research."

We added the detection of bugs in concretely not taken paths and a multi-layer filtering mechanism to concentrate symbolic reasoning on panic-relevant paths. Evaluation on five Go vulnerabilities demonstrates that panic-reachability gating achieves 1.8-3.9x speedups when filtering 33-70% of branches, and that Zorya detects all panics while existing tools detect at most two.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably."

    "abstract": "Chemical abundance radial gradients provide key information on how the processes that affect chemical enrichment of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM) act at different galaxy scales. Whereas in the last decades there has been an increase in the number of galaxies studied with integral field spectroscopy, there is still not a clear picture on a subsequent characterization of the chemical abundance radial gradients in galaxies hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This lack of analysis is even more accentuated in the case of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). For the first time, we analyze the chemical abundance radial gradients in a sample of LINER-like galaxies, whose nuclear emission has been previously (Paper I) discussed. We use a sample of 97 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA), whose nuclear regions show LINER-like emission. We use the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry to estimate the chemical abundance ratios 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) in the HII regions across the disks in our sample, as well as in the nuclear parts where the LINER-like activity dominates. To fit the radial profiles we use a piecewise methodology which uses a non-fixed number of breaks to find the best fit for the data. We obtain that majority of our sample of galaxies exhibits departures from the single linear gradient both in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) (as expected from the inside-out scenario). We investigate whether these departures are driven by galaxy properties (stellar mass, neutral gas mass, stellar velocity dispersion), finding not correlation at all. We also report that in most cases there is no correlation between the shape of the 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) radial profiles. We propose a model in which AGN (feed)back, acting at different scales depending on the galaxy and its evolutionary stage, might be responsible for these departures."

In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. Similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather a circle compactification."

    "abstract": "Recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the DESI, when combined with CMB data and Type Ia supernovae observations, indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy when considering the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, over the standard ΛCDM or the wCDM model. However, the Bayes factor, a key metric for model comparison, remains inconclusive on which model is preferred. This paper applies the BF method, that integrates both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to DESI data to address the limitations of purely frequentist or Bayesian methods. It consists in considering the Bayes factor as a random variable and calculates its distribution, that results from values computed in a frequentist approach after perturbing the data following the model considered. We apply this hybrid method to DESI data, comparing the CPL and w models under various prior conditions, including weak and strong priors, and theory-informed priors. We find that, when the traditional bayes factor is considered, that weak priors favor the w model over CPL, while strong priors favor CPL. Additionally, theory-informed priors further enhance the preference for the w model. While when we apply the BF method, the preference for CPL over w is seen in all cases albeit with similar but reduced impact on the p-value from the different prior considerations. We also tried to generalize further, by perturbing as well the covariance matrix following the model considered, and found that, in general, the current data in that case is not stringent enough to disentangle between the two models. Our results demonstrate that varying the Bayes factor as a random variable, providing that the covariance matrix is kept as model independent, provides a robust model comparison, reducing the impact of prior dependence as well as offering quantitative assessment of the preferences of the competing models.(abridged)"

    "abstract": "Gentrification is the process by which wealthier individuals move into a previously lower-income neighbourhood. Among the effects of this multi-faceted phenomenon are rising living costs, cultural and social changes-where local traditions, businesses, and community networks are replaced or diluted by new, more affluent lifestyles-and population displacement, where long-term, lower-income residents are priced out by rising rents and property taxes. Despite its relevance, quantifying displacement presents difficulties stemming from lack of information on motives for relocation and from the fact that a long time-span must be analysed: displacement is a gradual process (leases end or conditions change at different times), impossible to capture in one data snapshot. We introduce a novel tool to overcome these difficulties. Using only publicly available address change data, we construct four cubical complexes which simultaneously incorporate geographical and temporal information of people moving, and then analyse them building on Topological Data Analysis tools. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of this method through a 20-year case study of Madrid, Spain. The results reveal its ability to capture population displacement and to identify the specific neighbourhoods and years affected--patterns that cannot be inferred from raw address change data."

Extensive experiments show that our LDP outperforms existing baselines on both automated metrics and rigorous clinical expert evaluations (achieving a Physician Score of 7.2/10), significantly reducing training computational costs by 833x compared to full fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural network verifiers operate by encoding neural network verification as constraint satisfaction problems. When dealing with standard piecewise-linear activation functions, such as ReLUs, verifiers typically employ branching heuristics that break a complex constraint satisfaction problem into multiple, simpler problems. The verifier's performance depends heavily on the order in which this branching is performed: a poor selection may give rise to exponentially many sub-problem, hampering scalability. Here, we focus on the setting where multiple verification queries must be solved for the same neural network. The core idea is to use past experience to make good branching decisions, expediting verification. We present a reinforcement-learning-based branching heuristic that achieves this, by applying a learning from demonstrations (DQfD) techniques. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates a substantial reduction in average verification time and in the average number of iterations required, compared to modern splitting heuristics. These results highlight the great potential of reinforcement learning in the context of neural network verification."

We show that a wide range of actors -- including parties, media, activist groups, and pseudonymous influencers -- mobilised support, provoked reactions, and shaped opinion within these communities. Through case studies of hashtag hijacking, embedded activism, and political \"megaphones\", we illustrate how campaigns leveraged fan cultures to amplify political messages. Our findings highlight mechanisms of political influence in ostensibly non-political online spaces and point toward the development of a broader framework in future work."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a nanohertz gravitational-wave (GW) background. As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation."

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray.

A promising process is molten salt electrolysis, which typically requires temperatures in excess of 900°C. Fission reactors do not depend on solar irradiance and are thus well suited for power generation on the Moon, especially during the 14-day lunar night. As of now, fission reactors have only been considered for electric power generation, but the reactor coolant could also be used directly to heat those processes to their required temperatures. In this work, a concept for a co-generation fission power plant on the Moon that can directly heat a MSE plant to the required temperatures and provide a surplus of electrical energy for the lunar base is presented. The neutron transport code Serpent 2 is used to model a ceramic core, gas-cooled very-high-temperature microreactor design and estimate its lifetime with a burnup simulation in hot conditions with an integrated step-wise criticality search. Calculations show a neutronically feasible operation time of at least 10 years at 100kW thermal power. The obtained power distributions lay a basis for further thermal-hydraulic studies on the technical feasibility of the reactor design and the power plant."

In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses. Once a consistent Hamiltonian description for their canonical counterparts is obtained, a hybrid quantization of the master functions follows naturally."

We establish the equivalence between prognosability (respectively, diagnosability) and pre-normality over a subset of the non-faulty language (respectively, a suffix of the faulty language). We then demonstrate the existence of supremal prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) and normal sublanguages. Furthermore, an algorithm is then designed to compute the supremal controllable, normal, and prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) sublanguages. Since DESs are typically composed of multiple components operating in parallel, pure local supervisors are generally insufficient, as prognosability and diagnosability are global properties of a system. Given the limited work on enforcing prognosability or diagnosability in modular DESs, where these properties are enforced through local supervisors, this paper leverages a refined version of pre-normality to compute modular supervisors for local subsystems. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to be globally controllable, normal, and prognosable/ diagnosable. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Single-bridge blockchain solutions enable cross-chain communication. However, they are associated with centralization and single-point-of-failure risks. This paper proposes Proof of Success and Reward Distribution (PSCRD), a novel multi-bridge response coordination and incentive distribution protocol designed to address the challenges. PSCRD introduces a fair reward distribution system that equitably distributes the transfer fee among participating bridges, incentivizing honest behavior and sustained commitment. The purpose is to encourage bridge participation for higher decentralization and lower single-point-of-failure risks. The mathematical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of PSCRD using two key metrics: the Gini index, which demonstrates a progressive improvement in the fairness of the reward distribution as new bridge groups joined the network; and the Nakamoto coefficient, which shows a significant improvement in decentralization over time. These findings highlight that PSCRD provides a more resilient and secure cross-chain bridge system without substantially increasing user costs."

    "abstract": "The principal aim of this paper is to establish a purity theorem for Mahler functions that is reminiscent of famous purity theorems for G-functions by D. and G. Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{é}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces."

While traditional rule-based systems can react to these commands, they often struggle in dynamic environments, and end-to-end methods face challenges in complying with explicit navigation commands. To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving."

These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples.

In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages."

Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances. Our work opens the path to the exploitation of quantum dot entangled-photon sources in quantum repeater networks."

The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $α$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $β$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $α$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $Γ_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $β$-phase to a low-symmetry $α$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $α$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs."

However, it remains an open question how neural mechanisms perform their abstract operations. We investigate a hypothesis where a distributed form of Bayesian inference, namely message passing on factor graphs, is performed by a simulated network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Specifically, we perform Gaussian belief propagation by encoding messages that come into factor nodes as spike-based signals, propagating these signals through a spiking neural network (SNN) and decoding the spike-based signal back to an outgoing message. Three core linear operations, equality (branching), addition, and multiplication, are realized in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models. Validation against the standard sum-product algorithm shows accurate message updates, while applications to Kalman filtering and Bayesian linear regression demonstrate the framework's potential for both static and dynamic inference tasks. Our results provide a step toward biologically grounded, neuromorphic implementations of probabilistic reasoning."

    "abstract": "Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed."

The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance.

Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots."

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for hypergraph pattern matching by introducing (1) the intersection constraint, a necessary and sufficient condition for valid embeddings, which significantly speeds up the verification process, (2) the candidate hyperedge space, a data structure that stores potential mappings between hyperedges in the query hypergraph and the data hypergraph, and (3) the Match-and-Filter framework, which interleaves matching and filtering operations to maintain only compatible candidates in the candidate hyperedge space during backtracking. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, by up to orders of magnitude in terms of query processing time."

Inflationary models make predictions for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of initial density fluctuations. In light of relevant data releases this year, we present constraints on these two parameters using the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation data (BAO) available. Using data from Planck, the South Pole Telescope, Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and BICEP/Keck experiments, we derive $n_s=0.9682\\,\\pm\\,0.0032$ and a 95% upper limit of $r<0.034$. This upper limit on $r$ is consistent with the official BICEP/Keck result given the numerical precision of the analyses and our choice to impose the self-consistency relation for single field slow-roll inflation on the tensor power spectrum; the $r$ constraint is not impacted by the additional CMB data. While adding DESI BAO data to the CMB data has a negligible impact on $r$, the $n_s$ constraint shifts upward to $0.9728\\,\\pm\\,0.0029$, which favours monomial inflaton potentials with $N_\\star\\sim 50$ over Starobinsky $R^2$ or Higgs inflation with $N_\\star = 51$ and $N_\\star = 55$, respectively. This shift is caused by marginally significant differences between the CMB and DESI data that remain unexplained in the context of the standard model. We show that a class of polynomial $α$-attractor models can predict the CMB and CMB+DESI $n_s$ results with $N_\\star=47.1$ and $N_\\star=55.1$, respectively. While future data will improve our sensitivity to $r$, robust $n_s$ constraints are just as crucial to differentiate between inflation models.

Recent literature has introduced the concept of local balance as a measure of the contribution of a single node to the overall balance of the network. In the present research, we investigate the potential of using deviations of local balance from global balance as a criterion for selecting outperforming assets. The underlying idea is that, during financial crises, most assets in the investment universe behave similarly: losses are severe and widespread, and the global balance of the correlation-based signed network reaches its maximum value. Under such circumstances, standard diversification (mainly related to portfolio size) is unable to reduce risk or limit losses. Therefore, it may be useful to concentrate portfolio exposures on the few assets - if such assets exist-that behave differently from the rest of the market. We argue that these assets are those for which the local balance strongly departs from the global balance of the underlying signed network. The paper supports this hypothesis through an application using real financial data. The results, in both descriptive and predictive contexts, confirm the proposed intuition."

The mass of the lepton-antilepton pair gives a unique mean to separate partonic from hadronic radiation. Thus, dileptons can be used to study the QGP equilibration time, its average temperature but also effects related to the restoration of chiral symmetry in the hot medium via vector meson decays. This information is not accessible with hadrons. The price to pay is a large background from ordinary hadron decays. We summarize the potential of dilepton measurements, the results obtained so far at colliders, and the ongoing efforts for future experiments with further increased sensitivity."

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions."

In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder."

    "abstract": "All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

    "abstract": "We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid quenching of satellite galaxies in dense environments is often attributed to environmental processes such as ram pressure stripping. However, stripping alone cannot fully account for the removal of dense, star-forming gas in many satellites, particularly in their inner regions. Recent models and indirect observations have suggested that star formation-driven outflows may play a critical role in expelling this remaining gas, yet direct evidence for such feedback-driven quenching remains limited. Here we report the discovery of an ionized gas outflow in NGC 4064, a Virgo cluster satellite that has already lost most of its cold gas through environmental stripping. MUSE observations from the Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) survey reveal a bi-polar outflow driven by residual, centrally concentrated star formation in NGC 4064 - despite its current star formation rate being ~0.4 dex below the star-forming main sequence due to prior interaction with the cluster environment. The outflow's mass loading factor is ~2, suggesting that stellar feedback could remove the remaining gas on timescales shorter than those required for depletion by star formation alone. These results demonstrate that even modest but centrally concentrated star formation can drive efficient feedback in stripped satellites, accelerating quenching in the final stages of their evolution."

    "abstract": "In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable."

These features are then tied to the Lorentz-violating spacetime structure, which governs the propagation of the neutrinos. Numerical simulations are carried out for both two- and three-flavor descriptions, with normal and inverted mass orderings."

For this normal form, we prove the existence of infinite set of homoclinic orbits with different topological structure defined by the number of rotations around axis of symmetry. We show that these rotational topological features are inherited by the attractors of Chen-type systems and give rise to their twisted nature - the generic difference from attractors of Lorenz type."

Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential \"blink-like\" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding."

We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights."

We benchmark the feasibility and scalability of this approach against classical Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) solvers such as Gurobi and CPLEX. Results show that the CQM formulation achieves feasible solutions with stable runtimes as quadratic density increases, demonstrating 10 to 100 times faster convergence and reduced computational time compared with classical solvers, while also improving route smoothness by approximately 10 percent and reducing total length by approximately 1 percent.

We obtain an estimate of the invariant measure on the bounded set in the Sobolev space $W^{k^\\star,p^\\star} $, where $k^\\star p^\\star>1$, and $p^\\star$ is large.

The port of Ciutadella (Menorca), is a recognized hotspot for meteotsunami occurrence. This study presents a 50-year analysis of 191 meteotsunami events recorded in Ciutadella between 1975 and 2025, focusing on the distinction between the convective and non-convective nature of the pressure disturbances that triggered the meteotsunami event and their implications for predictability and risk assessment. Events were classified using historical records, in-situ barographic and sea-level observations, satellite imagery, and lightning data. Results show that non-convective meteotsunamis are typically triggered by internal gravity waves, producing relatively regular and moderate pressure fluctuations. In contrast, convective events are associated with abrupt pressure jumps and tend to produce the most extreme sea-level oscillations, exceeding 3-4 meters in some cases, such as the catastrophic events of June 1984 and June 2006. Forecasting skill varied by event type: A full-realistic high-resolution ocean-atmosphere modelling system (BRIFS) performed better for convective cases, whereas a targeted reduced-physics method (TRAM) was more accurate for non-convective scenarios. This study provides the most extensive meteotsunami dataset for the Balearic Islands to date and offers a novel framework for understanding the contrasting dynamics and characteristics of both types of events. The results support the development of improved early-warning systems and more effective coastal risk mitigation strategies in vulnerable regions."

Two neurons are called parallel if they share a significant number of input neurons and output neurons. Most pairs of neurons in the Drosophila brain have very small parallel match. There are about twenty larger groups of neurons for which any pair of neurons in the group has a high match. These are the parallel groups. Parallel groups contain only about 1000 out of the 65,000 neurons in the brain, and have distinctive properties. There are groups in the right mushroom bodies, the antennal lobes, the lobula, and in two central neuropils (GNG and EB). Most parallel groups do not have lateral symmetry. A group usually has one major input neuron, which inputs to all the neurons in the group, and a small number of major output neurons. The major input and output neurons are laterally asymmetric. Parallel neuron groups present puzzles, such as: what does a group do, that could not be done by one larger neuron? Do all neurons in a group fire in synchrony, or do they perform different functions? Why are they laterally asymmetric? These may merit further investigation."

However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{y})$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets."

    "abstract": "Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions."

This motivates the need for better seismic constraints to refine stellar models. We investigate how internal structural features shape asteroseismic signatures in core helium-burning stars, focusing on the links between seismic properties and internal chemical profiles. Using an updated version of the Liege stellar evolution code and its adiabatic oscillation code, we compute and analyse mixed-mode patterns for a range of stellar models. Our results show that sharp chemical gradients and central overshooting strongly influence the mixed-mode spectra. Changes in overshooting modify the extent of the semi-convective region, altering the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency and thus the observed period spacing. Variations in overshooting are compensated by shifts in semi-convective layers, keeping the total mixed-core size nearly constant across models. As a result, stellar evolution is only mildly affected, while the seismic signatures, especially the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, are highly sensitive to these internal adjustments."

Projection methods offer an effective solution by decoupling these variables, making them suitable for large-scale computations. This work focuses on reduced-order modeling using incremental projection schemes for the Stokes equations. We present both semi-discrete and fully discrete formulations, employing BDF2 in time and finite elements in space. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach is adopted to construct a reduced-order model for the Stokes problem. The method enables explicit computation of reduced velocity and pressure while preserving accuracy. We provide a detailed stability analysis and derive error estimates, showing second-order convergence in time. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Effective code retrieval is indispensable and it has become an important paradigm to search code in hybrid mode using both natural language and code snippets. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios."

    "abstract": "A key aspect of human cognition is metacognition - the ability to assess one's own knowledge and judgment reliability. While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity)."

Starting from the UV completion and one-loop-matched Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$ of the gauge-invariant operator $O_{NB}=(\\bar{L}σ^{μν}P_RN)\\tilde{H}B_{μν}$, we compute the radiatively induced Weinberg operator $O_5$ and derive the light Majorana mass matrix generated by a double insertion of $O_{NB}$. For the benchmarks that realise successful resonant electromagnetic leptogenesis at the electroweak scale, these contributions yield neutrino masses far below the scale implied by neutrino oscillation data, so that the observed neutrino masses must originate from additional interactions such as one of the seesaw mechanisms, and only in extreme corners of parameter space do they saturate the cosmological bound on $\\sum m_ν$. We also show that no additional Dirac neutrino mass is generated at one loop by the dipole operator alone. Furthermore, we derive the charged-lepton dipole operator $O_{eγ}$ in LEFT, accounting for one-loop operator mixing in the symmetric phase and two-loop Barr--Zee--type graphs in the broken phase, and evolve its Wilson coefficient $C_{eγ}$ down to the muon and electron mass scales using QED renormalisation-group equations. The resulting analytic upper bounds on $\\mathrm{BR}(μ\\to eγ)$, the electron EDM, and $(g-2)_μ$ lie many orders of magnitude below current experimental sensitivities throughout the BAU-compatible region. Electromagnetic leptogenesis in this EFT framework is therefore robust against present constraints from light-neutrino masses and low-energy dipole probes."

To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies.

Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \\texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\\barν_e$ mean energy $\\langle E_{\\barν_e}\\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\\mathcal{L_ν}$ for both $ν_e$ and $\\barν_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\\barν_e$ emission while suppressing that of $ν_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\\langle E_{ν_e}\\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{ν_e}$ by increasing both $\\mathcal{L}_{ν_e}$ and $\\langle E_{ν_e}\\rangle$ whereas for $\\barν_e$, the rise in $\\mathcal{L}_{\\barν_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\\langle E_{\\barν_e}\\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\\barν_e}$.

We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras. The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras.

    "abstract": "We examine the westward-propagating quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) during boreal summer, with a focus on how background moisture and winds shape its structure and propagation. In dry regions, convection lags the circulation by nearly a quarter cycle, whereas in very moist regions it becomes nearly in-phase and extends across the QBWO gyre. As the background moistens, moisture anomalies increasingly align with the QBWO circulation. Despite differences in environmental moisture and wind conditions, several structural features remain robust: outgoing longwave radiation and moisture anomalies stay collocated, moisture and pressure-velocity anomalies remain vertically upright, and the filtered winds retain a first-baroclinic mode structure. A vorticity budget shows that, although the planetary vorticity-gradient term is important, both planetary stretching and horizontal advection are needed to explain the vorticity tendency- and their relative importance shifts with the moisture regime. In dry and moderately moist regions with easterly mean flow, mean winds primarily advect vorticity anomalies. In contrast, in very moist regions with westerly flow, anomalous winds instead advect the background vorticity. An analogous transition occurs in the moisture budget: in dry and moderately moist environments, zonal mean flow advection dominates, but in very moist regions, strong background moisture gradients allow eddy advection of the mean moisture field to become the leading term. In the moist regime, vertical advection, precipitation, and evaporation also contribute substantially to the moisture tendency. Overall, the QBWO behaves like a mean-flow-driven linear mode in dry and moderately moist regions with easterly background winds, but shifts toward a regime dominated by eddy advection of background vorticity and moisture in very moist regions characterized by westerly flow."

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs. Finally, this paper underscores the importance of high-resolution observations of the solar wind velocity distributions around RDs."

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios."

Applications such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue require robot swarms to cover large domains under resource constraints, making both coverage efficiency and safety essential. To address the efficiency aspect, we adopt the Density-Driven Control (D$^2$C) framework, which uses optimal transport theory to steer agents according to a reference distribution that encodes spatial coverage priorities. To ensure safety, we incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the framework. While CBFs are commonly used for collision avoidance, we extend their applicability by introducing obstacle-specific formulations for both circular and rectangular shapes. In particular, we analytically derive a unit normal vector based on the agent's position relative to the nearest face of a rectangular obstacle, improving safety enforcement in environments with non-smooth boundaries. Additionally, a velocity-dependent term is incorporated into the CBF to enhance collision avoidance. Simulation results validate the proposed method by demonstrating smoother navigation near obstacles and more efficient area coverage than the existing method, while still ensuring collision-free operation."

We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime. For $U(1)$ gauge theories, the counterpart is restricted to the massless sector within the continuous Proca spectrum, while for linearized gravity supertranslations are encoded in the partially massless sector and superrotations in the strictly massless sector. Using the identification, we reveal that the associated Ward-Takahashi identities of the cosmological correlators reproduce the conformally soft photon and graviton theorems via the cosmological-celestial dictionary.

Our approach reduces dimensionality compared with the standard product space technique, which typically reformulates the original problem as the sum of two maximally monotone operators in order to apply splitting methods.

High-mix discrete manufacturing systems require jointly optimizing mid-term production planning and machine-level scheduling under heterogeneous resources and stringent delivery commitments. We address this problem with a profit-driven integrated framework that couples a mixed-integer planning model with a machine-level scheduling heuristic. The planning layer allocates production, accessory co-production, and outsourcing under aggregate economic and capacity constraints, while the scheduling layer refines these allocations using a structure-aware procedure that enforces execution feasibility and stabilizes daily machine behavior. This hierarchical design preserves the tractability of aggregated optimization while capturing detailed operational restrictions. Evaluations are conducted on a real industrial scenario. A flexible machine-level execution scheme yields 73.3% on-time completion and significant outsourcing demand, revealing bottleneck congestion. In contrast, a stability-enforcing execution policy achieves 100% on-time completion, eliminates all outsourcing, and maintains balanced machine utilization with only 1.9 to 4.6% capacity loss from changeovers. These results show that aligning planning decisions with stability-oriented execution rules enables practical and interpretable profit-maximizing decisions in complex manufacturing environments."

    "abstract": "Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer."

Here we report a way to determine if a quantum key distribution model (or protocol) operates in an optimal behavior. This is accomplished by introducing a quantity, called optimality, which is the maximum over the total efficiency of a QKD under any circumstances (any values of QKD parameters). The optimality definition is given for the asymptotic operation of a QKD system - when infinitely many quantum systems are transferred/used in a quantum key distribution protocol or a quantum key distribution system is used infinitely many times. A way to attain the optimality is considered\\textemdash implementation of a completely efficient QKD system (a combination of capacity-reaching quantum channel and a completely compressed classical channel) is presented. Optimal versions of BB84-QKD and twin-field QKD are introduced."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "This paper presents three quantitative sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources of the biharmonic wave equation using scattered field data. The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $Δu^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself."

    "abstract": "Incomplete multi-view data, where different views suffer from missing and unbalanced observations, pose significant challenges for clustering. Existing imputation-based methods attempt to estimate missing views to restore data associations, but indiscriminate imputation often introduces noise and bias, especially when the available information is insufficient. Imputation-free methods avoid this risk by relying solely on observed data, but struggle under severe incompleteness due to the lack of cross-view complementarity. To address this issue, we propose Informativeness-based Selective imputation Multi-View Clustering (ISMVC). Our method evaluates the imputation-relevant informativeness of each missing position based on intra-view similarity and cross-view consistency, and selectively imputes only when sufficient support is available. Furthermore, we integrate this selection with a variational autoencoder equipped with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior to learn clustering-friendly latent representations. By performing distribution-level imputation, ISMVC not only stabilizes the aggregation of posterior distributions but also explicitly models imputation uncertainty, enabling robust fusion and preventing overconfident reconstructions. Compared with existing cautious imputation strategies that depend on training dynamics or model feedback, our method is lightweight, data-driven, and model-agnostic. It can be readily integrated into existing IMC models as a plug-in module. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets under a more realistic and challenging unbalanced missing scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms both imputation-based and imputation-free approaches."

    "abstract": "In a collinear magnet, the predominant magnetic moments are collectively aligned along a specific spatial orientation, and this alignment may yield intriguing phenomena such as spin orientation driven polarization. It is well known that spin orientation driven polarization is a relativistic effect that widely occurs in various type-II multiferroics. However, a universal theory that describes such a phenomenon and directs the corresponding materials discovery is lacking. Here, we revisit the magnetic structures of collinear magnets and explore the spin-orientation-dependent phenomena therein. Based on symmetry principles, we analyze the spin point groups (SPGs) that are associated with collinear magnets in the non-relativistic regime, demonstrate how relativistic spin-orbit interaction reduces each SPG to various magnetic point groups that are associated with different magnetic alignments, and classify the SPGs with respect to spin orientation driven polarization. We employ our theory to elucidate the mechanisms of spin orientation driven polarization in a variety of type-II multiferroics. Combined with first-principles simulations, we further show that polarization may be driven in nonpolar collinear antiferromagnets (e.g., CuFeS$_2$) by reorienting their magnetic alignments. Our theory provides guidelines for designing and discovering materials with spin orientation driven polarization, which will benefit the development of spintronics based on type-II multiferroics and related materials."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters."

However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter."

After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \\le x \\le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35.

We employ Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model data, based on Earth's atmosphere, to derive temperature pressure profiles and couple them with a 1D photochemical model to assess the detectability of these molecules in Earth analogs located 10 parsecs away. We investigate the dominant reaction pathways and their contributions to the atmospheric composition of an Earth analog, with a focus on how they shape the resulting molecular signatures. We also examine the role of surface boundary conditions, which indirectly trace the effects of biological and geological processes, on the detectability of these molecules using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts. Our findings indicate that O3 is detectable with both mission concepts, while H2O requires specific surface humidity levels for detection with LIFE and shows only potential detectability with HWO. CO2 is detectable with LIFE. Both N2O and CH4 require continuous surface outgassing for potential detection with LIFE, and CH4 further requires low surface humidity to prevent masking by water features. Our work highlights the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of Earth analogs in the UV/VIS/NIR and mid-IR domains using HWO- and LIFE-type mission concepts and offers guidance for the development of future missions operating in these spectral regions."

However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad."

We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management."

We fit five XMM-Newton spectra of Fairall 9 using the hybrid reXcor model taking into account both hot and warm corona. The soft excess is explained by a combination of a physically motivated warm corona and the disc reflection. Then, we perform a wavelet coherence analysis of the light curves between 0.3 - 1 and 1 - 4 keV bands. The spectral fits are consistent with a rapidly spinning black hole ($a = 0.99$), a warm corona with optical depth $\\sim$10 - 30, and a hot lamp-post corona located at either 5 or $20~r_{\\rm g}$. This configuration supports a coexisting hot and warm corona scenario, allowing the disc to extend almost to the event horizon. Our wavelet analysis on combined observations reveals signatures of transient soft X-ray lags, confined to specific time-frequency intervals. The earlier observations exhibit more variable and transient lag behavior. In contrast, the later observations display more persistent soft X-ray lags at the frequencies of $\\sim 9\\times 10^{-6}$ - $2.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ Hz, with amplitudes reaching $\\sim$1000 s. The results indicate a progressively stable disc-corona configuration in later observations. Given the mass and geometry of Fairall 9, the observed soft lags appears plausibly consistent in both size and timescales with expectations from X-ray reverberation."

Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings."

Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty."

However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results."

    "abstract": "Non-random missing data is a ubiquitous yet undertreated flaw in multidimensional time series, fundamentally threatening the reliability of data-driven analysis and decision-making. Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/LRTC-TIDT."

    "abstract": "We analyze gradient descent with randomly weighted data points in a linear regression model, under a generic weighting distribution. This includes various forms of stochastic gradient descent, importance sampling, but also extends to weighting distributions with arbitrary continuous values, thereby providing a unified framework to analyze the impact of various kinds of noise on the training trajectory. We characterize the implicit regularization induced through the random weighting, connect it with weighted linear regression, and derive non-asymptotic bounds for convergence in first and second moments. Leveraging geometric moment contraction, we also investigate the stationary distribution induced by the added noise. Based on these results, we discuss how specific choices of weighting distribution influence both the underlying optimization problem and statistical properties of the resulting estimator, as well as some examples for which weightings that lead to fast convergence cause bad statistical performance."

However, limited access to flexible, open-source platforms continues to hinder widespread adoption and experimentation. In this paper, we present a low-cost neuromorphic processor implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA platform. The processor supports all-to-all configurable connectivity and employs the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model with customizable parameters such as threshold, synaptic weights, and refractory period. Communication with the host system is handled via a UART interface, enabling runtime reconfiguration without hardware resynthesis. The architecture was validated using benchmark datasets including the Iris classification and MNIST digit recognition tasks. Post-synthesis results highlight the design's energy efficiency and scalability, establishing its viability as a research-grade neuromorphic platform that is both accessible and adaptable for real-world spiking neural network applications. This implementation will be released as open source following project completion."

Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922).

The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits."

In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training."

Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems."

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

However, damage to the primary mirror due to micrometeoroid impacts will provide a stochastic, time-dependent source of stray light in the coronagraph's field of view that could significantly lengthen exposure times and reduce the expected science yield. To better quantify the impact of stray light and inform the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission design process, we present estimates of stray light in different micrometeoroid damage scenarios for a broad range of targets, and use that to find the expected decrease in science yield (i.e., the expected number of detected exoEarth candidates). We find that stray light due to micrometeoroid damage may significantly reduce yield, by 30% -- 60% in some cases, but significant uncertainties remain due to the unknown maximum expected impactor energy, and the relationship between impact energy and expected crater size. Micrometeoroid damage therefore needs further exploration, as it has the potential to reduce scientific yield, and in turn drive the development of mitigation strategies, selection of telescope designs, and selection of observing priorities in the future."

Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering."

Generally, RL offers advantages over traditional methods, particularly in market making. This study proposes a unified framework to address common concerns such as explainability, robustness, and deployment feasibility. Empirical evidence with synthetic data suggests that implementation quality and domain knowledge often outweigh algorithmic complexity. The study highlights the need for interpretable RL architectures for regulatory compliance, enhanced robustness in nonstationary environments, and standardized benchmarking protocols. Organizations should focus less on algorithm sophistication and more on market microstructure, regulatory constraints, and risk management in decision-making."

However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks."

Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees."

While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools. We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field. The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses. Comparison against drone-based infrared thermography (QScan) shows strong correspondence, correctly identifying all areas with high-loss receivers. This demonstrates that noisy real-world CSP operational data contain enough information to recover latent physical parameters when combined with appropriate modeling and differentiable optimization."

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework."

Intriguingly, despite LP 791-18c's radius, mass, and equilibrium temperature being in between those of K2-18b and TOI-270d, we find a drastically different transmission spectrum. While we also detect methane on LP 791-18c, its transit spectrum is dominated by strong haze scattering and there is no discernible CO$_2$ absorption. Overall, we infer a deep metal-enriched atmosphere (246-415$\\times$solar) for LP 791-18c, with a CO$_2$-to-CH$_4$ ratio smaller than 0.07 (at 2$σ$), indicating less H$_2$O in the deep envelope of LP 791-18c and implying a relatively dry formation inside the water ice-line.

We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like \"Maximum Mark Magyk\" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic."

    "abstract": "Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids."

    "abstract": "Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations."

The dark photon and a vector boson coupling to $B-L$ are special cases of our generalized flavor-universal anomaly-free vector boson, requiring just one additional parameter (the \"dark mixing angle\" corresponding to the linear combination of the electromagnetic and $B-L$ currents) beyond that of the overall coupling strength and the vector boson mass, where we focus on the range $1\\, {\\rm MeV}$ to $60\\, {\\rm GeV}$. We perform a detailed investigation of a unique combination where the vector boson couplings to electrically charged leptons and protons are highly suppressed: the \"chargephobic dark photon\". A chargephobic vector boson is very weakly constrained by current terrestrial experiments including beam dumps and collider experiments, since they rely on couplings to electrons and protons. Instead, neutrino scattering experiments (such as COHERENT), astrophysical sources (supernova emission), and cosmology ($ΔN_{\\rm eff}$) provide the strongest constraints due to the nonzero couplings of the chargephobic vector boson to neutrinos and neutrons. Indeed, we find that supernova emission and $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$ provide constraints throughout the space of dark mixing angles, demonstrating their importance to provide model-independent constraints. For nearly all of the parameter space, a chargephobic vector boson is the most weakly constrained anomaly-free vector boson that couples to flavor-independent or flavor-dependent combinations of Standard Model currents. Finally, we highlight the importance of future experiments, including SHiP, that are able to probe new regions of the chargephobic parameter space due to the significantly improved detector capabilities."

However, we show that the de Sitter analogs of these various interpretations do not necessarily coincide but rather lead to distinct, observer-dependent light-ray operators. We construct four such de Sitter analogs and analyze their matrix elements in a free, conformally coupled scalar theory, showing that they exhibit the expected symmetry and positivity properties."

Previous investigations have fully characterized the property for trees, established it for cycles, extended it to unicyclic graphs, and shown that bipartite graphs with a perfect matching always satisfy property $(P)$. However, whether the converse holds for connected bipartite graphs remains open in general. In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question on multiple fronts. We first prove that every connected bipartite graph satisfying property $(P)$ must be balanced, providing a fundamental necessary condition. We further establish complete characterizations for several significant families of bipartite graphs. Specially, we show that every connected bipartite graph of order at most $8$ has property $(P)$ if and only if it has a perfect matching, and more generally, that a connected bipartite graph of order $8+2k$ with at least $k$ pendant edges satisfies property $(P)$ exactly when it has a perfect matching. We further prove that within the class of triangular bipartite graphs, property $(P)$ is equivalent to the existence of a perfect matching, providing a full characterization for this broad structural subclass. In addition, we introduce the threaded union over a graph, a general operation for assembling larger graphs from smaller components, and show that threaded union over a tree--cycle block graph preserves property $(P)$. This significantly generalizes earlier result about joining two graphs with property $(P)$ by a single edge preserves property $(P)$."

This condition is based on the ratio of the energy density of spin-2 particles from the SU(2) gauge field to that of the background field. The perturbative treatment breaks down when this ratio exceeds unity. We show that this occurs within a parameter space nearly identical to the strong backreaction regime identified in previous studies. However, in some cases, the ratio exceeds unity even before the system enters the strong backreaction regime. Our results suggest that attempts to study the strong backreaction regime using perturbation theory are necessarily limited. Reliable calculations require non-perturbative treatments, such as three-dimensional lattice simulations."

In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $μ$s, reaching $\\bar n \\approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control."

    "abstract": "Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation."

We validate this framework through sports viewing, a domain with rich dynamics and strong social traditions, where a pilot study with soccer fans suggests that multi-agent interaction improves perceived social presence compared to solo viewing. We contribute: (1) a generalizable framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations around multimodal video content, (2) a novel evaluator-agent pipeline for conversation quality control, and (3) exploratory evidence of increased social presence in AI-mediated co-viewing. We discuss challenges and future directions for applying this approach to diverse viewing contexts including entertainment, education, and collaborative watching experiences."

A major challenge in achieving a complete SM prediction and interpreting this discrepancy lies in the treatment of nonlocal hadronic effects. In $B \\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$, these effects are cast in a single nonlocal form factor, a function of squared momentum transfer $q^2$ to the lepton pair. One of the previously used methods provides this form factor in the region of spacelike momentum transfer, $q^2<0$, matching the result to the hadronic dispersion relation, which is then continued to the physical region. The calculation done so far was a combination of QCD factorisation for hard-gluon contributions with light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) for soft-gluon ones. In this work, we calculate for the first time the complete nonlocal form factor at $q^2<0$ for one of the effective operators, the chromomagnetic operator $O_{8g}$, applying the method of LCSRs with $ B$-meson distribution amplitudes. We compute, both analytically and numerically, the operator-product expansion (OPE) diagrams with hard-gluon exchanges, analyse their structure and hierarchy, and obtain their spectral density entering the LCSR together with soft-gluon contributions. This study paves the way for our next task, a complete calculation of nonlocal $B \\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ form factor at spacelike $q^2$, including the dominant contributions of current-current operators, known as charm-loops."

However, even in the large family of perovskite materials, this allows for only a limited, discrete set of strain states to be achieved. Here we report on an approach to controlling epitaxial strain for the growth of perovskite materials by involving a single SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate (the most available perovskite in single crystal form) and a buffer layer that consists of the solid solution Sr(Sn, Ge)$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$, of which the lattice parameter can be tuned in a continuous fashion, from 3.880 Å up to 4.007 Å, while maintaining coherent epitaxial growth on SrTiO$_{3}$ with high quality interfaces. Using a BaTiO$_{3}$ overlayer as a model system, we show that changes to the buffer layer composition, i.e. increase of in-plane lattice parameter, change the strain state of BaTiO$_{3}$ from fully relaxed, through highly compressively strained, to an exotic state showing 'inverted' epitaxy in which the buffer layer is relaxed from the substrate but lattice matched to the overlayer."

A generic abstract interpretation framework is not truly flexible if it does not allow interpreting with different path- and flow-sensitivities, by going forwards or backwards, and over- or under-approximately. Most interpreters inherently intertwine syntax and semantics, making the implementation antagonistic to modularity. Current approaches to modular designs require the use of complex data structures (e.g., monad transformers), providing modularity but often proving unwieldy (e.g., lifts). We observe that leveraging scoped effects within an interpreter facilitates the accumulation of semantic fragments against a fixed syntax. In this paper, we define cumulative abstract semantics, illustrating the potential for creating multiple dynamic evaluators and static analyses from one interpreter. This modularity is achieved by grouping effects into two categories: syntax elimination and domain-semantic introduction handlers. Our contribution shows the benefits of using effects as an instrument for designing a clean, elegant, and modular abstract interpretation framework."

Some main theorems in Yang's proof hold under a weaker condition called weak RC-positivity. It is therefore natural to ask if (uniform) weak RC-positivity implies (uniform) RC-positivity. Another motivation for studying this problem is to understand the relation between rational connectedness of $X$ and (uniform) RC-positivity of the holomorphic tangent bundle $TX$. In this paper, we obtain results in this direction. In particular, we show that if a vector bundle $E$ is uniformly weakly RC-positive, then $S^kE\\otimes \\det E$ is uniformly RC-positive for any $k\\geq 0$, and $S^kE$ is uniformly RC-positive for $k$ large.

    "abstract": "For scientific knowledge to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, it needs to be machine-readable. Moving forward from post-publication extraction of knowledge, we adopted a pre-publication approach to write research findings in a machine-readable format at early stages of data analysis. For this purpose, we developed the package dtreg in Python and R. Registered and persistently identified data types, aka schemata, which dtreg applies to describe data analysis in a machine-readable format, cover the most widely used statistical tests and machine learning methods. The package supports (i) downloading a relevant schema as a mutable instance of a Python or R class, (ii) populating the instance object with metadata about data analysis, and (iii) converting the object into a lightweight Linked Data format. This paper outlines the background of our approach, explains the code architecture, and illustrates the functionality of dtreg with a machine-readable description of a t-test on Iris Data. We suggest that the dtreg package can enhance the methodological repertoire of researchers aiming to adhere to the FAIR principles."

We then develop an alternative method based on exact cost-increment formulas and finite-difference probes of the terminal cost. We show that our method exhibits stable monotone convergence in numerical analysis of an Amari-type neural field control problem."

To achieve a full understanding of the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process, we studied the structure-property relationship for a series of carbazole based TADF emitters, 2CzPN, 4CzPN, 4CzIPN, 4CzBN and 5CzBN. We applied density functional theory to investigate kinetic and electronic properties. We find that the energetic position of triplet excited state of these emitters depends on their molecular structure. Our findings emphasize that to enable reverse intersystem crossing and eventually TADF, strong spin orbit coupling and minimal energy difference between singlet and triplet states $ΔE_{ST}$ must be obtained simultaneously. We also find that the reverse intersystem crossing rates $k_{RISC}$ values are higher where $ΔE_{ST}$ values are closer to reorganization energy. Furthermore, a small change in the absorption peak of optical absorption spectra with and without spin orbit coupling (SOC) is observed for each emitter. This result is extremely beneficial for the design of new TADF molecules, and we believe that our work contributes to the progress of future development of high-performance organic molecular light-emitting devices."

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers."

    "abstract": "Multiple proton-proton collisions (pile-up) occur at every bunch crossing at the LHC, with the mean number of interactions expected to reach 80 during Run 3 and up to 200 at the High-Luminosity LHC. As a direct consequence, events with multijet signatures will occur at increasingly high rates. To cope with the increased luminosity, being able to efficiently group jets according to their origin along the beamline is crucial, particularly at the trigger level. In this work, a novel uncertainty-aware jet regression model based on a Deep Sets architecture is introduced, DIPz, to regress on a jet origin position along the beamline. The inputs to the DIPz algorithm are the charged particle tracks associated to each jet. An event-level discriminant, the Maximum Log Product of Likelihoods (MLPL), is constructed by combining the DIPz per-jet predictions. MLPL is cut-optimized to select events compatible with targeted multi-jet signature selection. This combined approach provides a robust and computationally efficient method for pile-up rejection in multi-jet final states, applicable to real-time event selections at the ATLAS High Level Trigger."

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available."

This analytical tractability allows model parameters to be estimated using standard gradient-based optimization techniques. We also address improper solutions associated with maximum likelihood factor analysis. We propose a prescription to avoid improper solutions by imposing a constraint that row vectors of the factor loading matrix have the same norm for all features. Then, we prove that the proposed factor analysis is identifiable under the norm constraint. We demonstrate the validity of this norm constraint prescription and numerically verified the model's identifiability using both real and synthetic datasets. We also compare the proposed model with quantification method and found that the proposed model achieves better reproducibility of correlations than the quantification method."

In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $δθ_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})(λ_{\\mathrm{GW}}/r) \\approx 2~\\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels. We argue, therefore, that a coherent analysis of PTA data, fully incorporating pulsar distance information, is timely."

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative AI has undermined traditional modular assessments in computing education, creating a disconnect between academic evaluation and industry practice. This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation. We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity. Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation. Interconnected projects remain strongly correlated with modular assessments, suggesting they measure the same underlying skills while resisting AI misuse. Proctored exams show weaker alignment, implying they may assess test-taking ability rather than intended learning outcomes. Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design framework. The proposed approach enables educators to create assessments that promote integrative thinking, reflect real-world AI-augmented workflows, and naturally resist trivial delegation to generative AI, thereby helping restore academic integrity."

In this paper we explore an alternative, the \"multiple impact hypothesis\", which relaxes the compositional constraints on both the target and projectile, and allows for the consideration of more probable, less extreme impacts that steadily grow the Earth and Moon to their current size over several impact events. Using the hydrodynamical code SWIFT, we simulate \"chains\" of impacts and follow the growth of a moon around a planet analogous to our own. Our results demonstrate that chains of three or more impacts can produce systems comparable to the Earth-Moon system whilst achieving higher compositional similarities than the canonical giant impact scenario.

However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms."

By considering coalgebras over categories of suitably indexed families, the correctness of the corresponding algorithms follows intrinsically just from the type of the computed maps. However, proving recursivity of the underlying coalgebras is non-trivial, and proofs are typically ad hoc. This layer of complexity impedes the formalization of coalgebraically defined recursive algorithms in proof assistants. We introduce a framework for constructing coalgebras which are intrinsically recursive in the sense that the type of the coalgebra guarantees recursivity from the outset. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a well-founded functor on a category of families indexed by a well-founded relation. We show as our main result that every coalgebra for a well-founded functor is recursive, and demonstrate that well-known techniques for proving recursivity and termination such as ranking functions are subsumed by this abstract setup. We present a number of case studies, including Quicksort, the Euclidian algorithm, and CYK parsing. Both the main theoretical result and selected case studies have been formalized in Cubical Agda."

Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image. Several experiments based on synthetic and real data are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of imaging quality and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks."

For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance."

However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a \"passive accumulation\" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research."

The resulting rate, which depends nonperturbatively on both the Coulomb field of the ion and the constant crossed field, is calculated in a broad range of applied field strengths and nuclear charge numbers.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals."

We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt."

The two-level estimators exhibit the expected $1/N_1^2$ scaling of the variance, up to exponential boundary effects, and achieve an exponential reduction of statistical errors at nearly the same computational cost as standard sampling.

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in simulating high Reynolds number ($Re$) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) is the long streamwise distance required for large-scale outer-layer structures to develop, making such simulations prohibitively expensive. We propose an inflow generation method for high $Re$ wall turbulence that leverages the known structure and scaling laws of TBLs, enabling shorter development lengths by providing rich input information. As observed from the inner-scaled pre-multiplied spectra of streamwise velocity, with an increase in $Re$ the outer region grows and occupies more of the spanwise wavenumber space in proportion to the increase in $Re$; while the inner region remains approximately the same. Exploiting this behavior, we generate high-$Re$ inflow conditions for a $\\textit{target}$ $Re$ by starting from cross-stream velocity slices at a lower $\\textit{base}$ $Re$. In spectral space, we identify the inner and outer region wavenumbers, and shift the outer-region components proportionally to the desired $Re$ increase. We closely examine the capability of this method by scaling a set of velocity slices at $Re_θ=2240$ and $4430$ to $Re_θ=8000$, and using them as inflow conditions for direct numerical simulations (DNS) of spatially developing TBLs growing from $Re_θ=8000-9000$. The skin friction coefficient and shape factor predicted by the new method, regardless of the $\\textit{base}$ $Re$ tested, is within $\\pm3.5\\%$ and $\\pm0.5\\%$, respectively, of that of a precursor simulation right from the inlet. Reynolds stresses match very well after approximately $8~δ_{99_0}$. This gives an order of magnitude reduction in development length compared to other methods proposed in the literature."

As part of a broader effort to explore all four BSC perspectives, we identify, categorise, and interrelate hundreds of metrics within a comprehensive taxonomy structured around three core clusters: Data Quality, Governance & Compliance, and Operational Efficiency. The taxonomy consolidates overlapping definitions, clarifies conceptual dependencies, and links technical, organisational, and regulatory indicators that underpin data value creation. By integrating these dimensions, it provides a foundation for the development of standardised and evidence-based valuation frameworks. Beyond its theoretical contribution, the taxonomy supports ongoing practical applications in decision-support systems and data valuation models, advancing the broader goal of establishing a coherent, dynamic approach to assessing and monetising data across industries."

    "abstract": "Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

In this setting, we consider a continuous-time version of the SCA auction in which the prices follow a differential inclusion with a piecewise-constant dynamics. We show that there exists a unique solution in the sense of Filippov. This guarantees that the continuous-time model coincides with the limit of the discrete-time auction when price increments tend to zero. Moreover, we show that the value function of this limit auction is piecewise linear (though possibly discontinuous).

The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \\textbf{P}oint-\\textbf{to}-\\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\\% on R5@0.1 on MAD)."

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness."

However, the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnets and the induced spin dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications."

In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections."

    "abstract": "Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA."

    "abstract": "The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved."

The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \\[ R_0=\\fracβγλ_{\\max}(M), \\] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0<1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0>1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks."

Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates."

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes. Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk. Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations. Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease."

Overall, the results suggest that Midwest wind-rich regions can support competitive green hydrogen production for industrial heat, with grid-connected electrolysers remaining attractive in locations with frequent low LMP periods. This dual-path analysis provides a transparent framework for industrial hydrogen deployment and highlights practical transition strategies for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing."

This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction."

However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

    "abstract": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics."

To address this difficulty, we revisit the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the projection problem and introduce relaxed conditions that remain sufficient for characterizing the solution. These conditions lead to a simple geometric interpretation: finding the solutions is equivalent to locating the intersection of two monotone piecewise linear functions. Building on this insight, we propose an iterative and highly efficient algorithm that searches directly for the intersection point and completely avoids all sorting procedures. We prove that the algorithm converges globally and reaches the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. Extensive numerical experiments further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms existing algorithms and exhibits empirical O(n) complexity across a broad range of problem instances."

Magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars and a leading progenitor candidate for FRBs also produce similar but much fainter millisecond radio pulses, suggesting a possible connection between the two phenomena. The irregularity of the time series of repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses may provide insight into the underlying progenitor activity. In this study, we analyze time-series data from three repeating FRB sources (four datasets) and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 to investigate potential patterns in burst arrival times, energy fluctuations, and peak-frequency shifts. We quantify the degree of randomness (Pincus Index; PI) and chaos (Largest Lyapunov Exponent; LLE) for these three parameters. We find that waiting times across all repeating FRBs exhibit high PI (high randomness) and low LLE (low chaos), consistent with the behavior of magnetar radio pulses. This similarity suggests that both may share a common triggering mechanism. In contrast, the energy fluctuations of both repeating FRBs and magnetar pulses occupy the same region in PI-LLE phase space but display much larger scatter than the other two domains. We discuss the possibility that beaming effects or strong variability in radio-emission efficiency may explain their distinct behavior in the energy domain."

Previous research has often examined text or users in isolation, overlooking the structural context in which such toxic interactions occur. Without considering who interacts with whom and around what content, it is difficult to explain why negative expressions cluster within particular communities. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Chinese social video platform Bilibili, incorporating video-level information as the environment for user expression, modeling users and videos in an interaction matrix. After normalization and dimensionality reduction, we perform separate clustering on both sides of the video-user interaction matrix with K-means. Cluster assignments facilitate comparisons of user behavior, including message length, posting frequency, and source (barrage and comment), as well as textual features such as sentiment and toxicity, and video attributes defined by uploaders. Such a clustering approach integrates structural ties with content signals to identify stable groups of videos and users. We find clear stratification in interaction style (message length, comment ratio) across user clusters, while sentiment and toxicity differences are weak or inconsistent across video clusters. Across video clusters, viewing volume exhibits a clear hierarchy, with higher exposure groups concentrating more toxic expressions. For such a group, platforms should require timely intervention during periods of rapid growth. Across user clusters, comment ratio and message length form distinct hierarchies, and several clusters with longer and comment-oriented messages exhibit lower toxicity. For such groups, platforms should strengthen mechanisms that sustain rational dialogue and encourage engagement across topics."

    "abstract": "For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped. To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient physical simulations are essential in science and engineering, yet traditional numerical solvers face significant challenges in computational cost when handling simulations across dynamic scenarios involving complex geometries, varying boundary/initial conditions, and diverse physical parameters. While deep learning offers promising alternatives, existing methods often struggle with flexibility and generalization, particularly on unstructured meshes, which significantly limits their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose PhysGTO, an efficient Graph-Transformer Operator for learning physical dynamics through explicit manifold embeddings in both physical and latent spaces. In the physical space, the proposed Unified Graph Embedding module aligns node-level conditions and constructs sparse yet structure-preserving graph connectivity to process heterogeneous inputs. In the latent space, PhysGTO integrates a lightweight flux-oriented message-passing scheme with projection-inspired attention to capture local and global dependencies, facilitating multilevel interactions among complex physical correlations. This design ensures linear complexity relative to the number of mesh points, reducing both the number of trainable parameters and computational costs in terms of floating-point operations (FLOPs), and thereby allowing efficient inference in real-time applications. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning eleven datasets, covering problems with unstructured meshes, transient flow dynamics, and large-scale 3D geometries. PhysGTO consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, demonstrating superior flexibility, scalability, and generalization in a wide range of simulation tasks."

We establish the first nontrivial monotonicity guarantees for the maximum likelihood estimator in a variety of well-specified parametric settings. For sequential prediction with log loss, we show monotonicity (in fact complete monotonicity) of the forward KL divergence for Gaussian vectors with unknown covariance and either known or unknown mean, as well as for Gamma variables with unknown scale parameter. The Gaussian setting was explicitly highlighted as open in the aforementioned works, even in dimension 1. Finally we observe that for reverse KL divergence, a folklore trick yields monotonicity for very general exponential families. All results in this paper were derived by variants of GPT-5.2 Pro. Humans did not provide any proof strategies or intermediate arguments, but only prompted the model to continue developing additional results, and verified and transcribed its proofs."

    "abstract": "Variational-hemivariational inequalities are an area full of interesting and challenging mathematical problems. The area can be viewed as a natural extension of that of variational inequalities. Variational-hemivariational inequalities are valuable for application problems from physical sciences and engineering that involve non-smooth and even set-valued relations, monotone or non-monotone, among physical quantities. In the recent years, there has been substantial growth of research interest in modeling, well-posedness analysis, development of numerical methods and numerical algorithms of variational-hemivariational inequalities. This survey paper is devoted to a brief account of well-posedness and numerical analysis results for variational-hemivariational inequalities. The theoretical results are presented for a family of abstract stationary variational-hemivariational inequalities and the main idea is explained for an accessible proof of existence and uniqueness. To better appreciate the distinguished feature of variational-hemivariational inequalities, for comparison, three mechanical problems are introduced leading to a variational equation, a variational inequality, and a variational-hemivariational inequality, respectively. The paper also comments on mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities, with examples from applications in fluid mechanics, and on results concerning the numerical solution of other types (nonstationary, history dependent) of variational-hemivariational inequalities."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified modeling framework to capture the equilibrium-state interactions among ride-hailing companies, travelers, and traffic of mixed-autonomy transportation networks. Our framework integrates four interrelated sub-modules: (i) the operational behavior of representative ride-hailing Mixed-Fleet Traffic Network Companies (MiFleet TNCs) managing autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HV) fleets, (ii) traveler mode-choice decisions taking into account travel costs and waiting time, (iii) capped customer waiting times to reflect the option available to travelers not to wait for TNCs' service beyond his/her patience and to resort to existing travel modes, and (iv) a flow-dependent traffic congestion model for travel times. A key modeling feature distinguishes AVs and HVs across the pickup and service (customer-on-board) stages: AVs follow Wardrop pickup routes but may deviate during service under company coordination, whereas HVs operate in the reverse manner. The overall framework is formulated as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP), which is equivalent to a Variational Inequality(VI) formulation based on which the existence of a variational equilibrium solution to the traffic model is established. Numerical experiments examine how AV penetration and Wardrop relaxation factors, which bound route deviation, affect company, traveler, and system performance to various degrees. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers on regulating AV adoption and company vehicle deviation behavior in modern-day traffic systems that are fast changing due to the advances in technology and information accessibility."

    "abstract": "Wildfires pose significant threats to ecosystems and communities, yet accurately modeling fire spread remains challenging, particularly in regions where environmental and fuel data are scarce or unavailable. This study introduces an innovative conceptual and methodological framework for simulating wildfire propagation and estimating the rate of spread using a hybrid geometric and data-driven approach that relies exclusively on multi-source satellite observations. The framework integrates thermal fire-front detections, atmospheric conditions, and vegetation indices using two complementary geometric modeling strategies. The first strategy applies the Huygens principle, where generalized elliptical frames are expanded locally at every point along the fire perimeter, and their combined envelope forms the evolving wavefront. This method is best suited for situations in which environmental variables are available and can be incorporated to refine the anisotropic spread function. The second strategy relies solely on the generalized elliptical frames themselves; for each time step, an elliptical frame is constructed from the inferred head and back rates of spread and wind, and the burned area is obtained by enclosing the region determined by these curves. Together, these two methods provide a flexible toolkit that adapts to both data-rich and data-limited conditions while retaining a unified geometric interpretation of wildfire spread. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we present a case study based on the Eaton Fire, January 2025, using publicly available multi-day satellite imagery. Despite the absence of complete operational datasets for that event, the model driven only by satellite-derived parameters reproduces key qualitative features of the observed propagation pattern, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach in data-limited contexts."

To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation."

A natural question is whether this bound also holds for the list-chromatic number, i.e., whether $χ_{\\ell}(G^2) \\leq 6$ for such graphs. More generally, it is of interest to determine sufficient conditions ensuring $χ_{\\ell}(G^2) \\leq 6$ for subcubic planar graphs.

    "abstract": "Automated audio captioning models frequently produce overconfident predictions regardless of semantic accuracy, limiting their reliability in deployment. This deficiency stems from two factors: evaluation metrics based on n-gram overlap that fail to capture semantic correctness, and the absence of calibrated confidence estimation. We present a framework that addresses both limitations by integrating confidence prediction into audio captioning and redefining correctness through semantic similarity. Our approach augments a Whisper-based audio captioning model with a learned confidence prediction head that estimates uncertainty from decoder hidden states. We employ CLAP audio-text embeddings and sentence transformer similarities (FENSE) to define semantic correctness, enabling Expected Calibration Error (ECE) computation that reflects true caption quality rather than surface-level text overlap. Experiments on Clotho v2 demonstrate that confidence-guided beam search with semantic evaluation achieves dramatically improved calibration (CLAP-based ECE of 0.071) compared to greedy decoding baselines (ECE of 0.488), while simultaneously improving caption quality across standard metrics. Our results establish that semantic similarity provides a more meaningful foundation for confidence calibration in audio captioning than traditional n-gram metrics."

Under high traffic, agents average just 0.75 seconds of decision latency. To coordinate many agents in real-time, we implement a non-blocking asynchronous architecture using Unity coroutines and a dedicated request manager. The environment is a weighted undirected graph with live congestion metrics, updated continuously by the agents to enable shared perception. Our results show LLM-driven agents can dynamically adapt to traffic, reroute around congestion, and exhibit behaviors beyond static pathfinding, all while maintaining real-time performance. This work provides a reproducible framework for future research in adaptive routing and multi-agent cooperation."

We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog \"Bayesian Machines\" operating at inherently low precision."

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings. Collectively, the thesis unifies constrained RL across average-cost, episodic, and preference-driven paradigms, delivering theoretical advances and practical tools for safe and aligned decision-making."

To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses."

This dissertation investigates how repeated co-investment ties and domain-expertise homophily influence a venture's exit likelihood, timing, and route amid the sector's pronounced technological and market uncertainty. Using a novel panel of 11,680 biotechnology start-ups from the United States, Canada, and Europe (2010-2024), we apply pooled logit, Cox proportional-hazards, multinomial logit, and Fine-Gray competing-risk models. Our findings show that both average prior co-investment and investor homophily exhibit robust inverted-U relationships with exit outcomes. Moderate familiarity and scientific overlap maximize exit probability, while either sparse or excessive embedding reduces success. Governance mechanisms also play a crucial role: participation of a pharmaceutical corporate VC or a highly independent board flattens the negative effects of over-embedding, enabling syndicates to sustain exit momentum at higher levels of familiarity or homogeneity. Furthermore, the optimal degree of embeddedness is route-specific: IPOs require deeper coordination than trade sales, while acquisitions peak earlier and are less sensitive to homophily. These findings refine network-embeddedness theory in the life-science context, identify governance contingencies, and offer practitioners quantitative metrics to balance trust, expertise, and oversight in biotech financing."

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data."

This work presents the first coherent quantum circuit for simulating an M/G/1/K queue under arbitrary service-time laws. The circuit encodes the service distribution through a logarithmic-depth ladder of $R_y$ rotations and enforces buffer constraints via a comparator-controlled phase gate, while preserving the quadratic speed-up of amplitude amplification. Grover iterations center on estimating the expected number of customers in the system, yielding provable $O(\\sqrt{N})$ variance reduction and closed-form confidence bounds, where $N$ denotes the number of shots. Empirical evaluations on IBM quantum simulators across four service distributions and three traffic intensities demonstrate fidelity above 0.99 with four qubits and above 0.76 with ten qubits, with Jensen-Shannon divergence below 0.11. Waiting-time estimation errors decrease by an order of magnitude as system load approaches capacity and remain within 3% in high-traffic regimes using registers of up to 63 qubits. These results establish the first end-to-end quantum simulation framework for finite-buffer, non-Markovian queueing systems and provide a concrete foundation for quantum-accelerated performance analysis in service-oriented architectures."

This method adds an extra time dimension during data collection by recording multiple electron event-sparse diffraction patterns. The resulting datasets are effectively five-dimensional, referred to as locally time-resolved STEM (LTR-STEM). Diffraction data stacks at each scan position are processed using one of two sparsity denoising pipelines: 1) the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm followed by multi-step persistence thresholding, or 2) sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), followed by single-step thresholding. Both methods perform well for diffraction data denoising, as shown by simulated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) curves, denoised experimental data for virtual imaging, and application-specific denoising for defect detection. PSNR analysis indicates that sparsity-denoised 4D-STEM data reaches the same PSNR as raw data at approximately 16% of the exposure time, demonstrating comparable image quality with a lower dose. In defect detection, a 4.1x increase in sensitivity to relative radial disk shift is observed in the denoised data. Moreover, the LTR-STEM technique may be used to inspect material degradation by tracking changes in diffraction disk intensity, allowing for critical dose estimation and exposure-selective imaging."

To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel monetization strategies, among which LLM-native advertising has emerged as a promising paradigm by naturally integrating advertisement within LLM-generated responses. However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties."

The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results."

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization.

We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $χ({\\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping)."

Our approach combines a tailored finite-dimensional reduction with a blow-up analysis based on Pohozaev identities and, in this way, extends the two-dimensional mass-critical result for $(n,p)=(2,3)$ obtained in Guo--Tian--Zhou (Calc.\\ Var.\\ Partial Differential Equations, 2022). The proof in that paper relies in an essential way on the two-dimensional structure and does not directly apply in higher dimensions, whereas here we develop a different approximation scheme and functional setting adapted to the high-dimensional sphere-at-infinity concentration regime."

Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy."

Many practical applications involve combinations of deformation modes, such as uniaxial extension and biaxial compression, yet a unified description of their mechanical response remains challenging. In this study, we apply a consistent theoretical framework to describe both uniaxial and biaxial deformation modes, using the same constitutive formalism based on van der Waals network theory. The time dependence of the material response in both cases is governed by a substance specific relaxation spectrum, introduced through irreversible thermodynamics as a linear coupling to the quasi static reference state of the permanent network. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times is well described by the Williams Landel Ferry (WLF) equation in the high temperature or low strain rate regime, demonstrating that the same physical mechanisms underlie time dependent behavior across different loading geometries. Experimental results are presented for cross linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), validating the theoretical model across both materials and deformation modes."

The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building.

However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line."

In this work, we use a microscopic framework to calculate angle-dependent magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation within the YRZ model. Our calculations simultaneously reproduce the experimentally observed Yamaji oscillations and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation corresponding to a pocket area of about $p/8$, with $p$ the hole density. By further testing the effect of Green's-function zeros, we confirm that isolated zeros leave the oscillation period unchanged, whereas an extended zero segment suppresses and modifies the oscillation. Our findings demonstrate that the YRZ model captures essential features of the pseudogap regime and provides a general quantum approach that can be applied to more complex electronic structures."

First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\\sqrt{d})$.

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance."

To address this question, we predict the di-$J/Ψ$ and $J/ΨΨ(2S)$ femtoscopic correlation functions based on the Koonin-Pratt formula with a Gaussian source and the coupled-channel dynamics. Our results show that the di-$J/Ψ$ correlation function exhibits distinctly different behaviors in each scenario, especially for small source sizes ($R\\sim1$ fm), providing a clear experimental observable to distinguish the nature of $X(6200)$. These distinguishing features persist even when quantum statistical effects and coupled-channel dynamics are included and show negligible sensitivity to off-shell ambiguities. Given the high $J/Ψ$ production rates and clean detection channels at the LHC, we hope that these discoveries will stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of double-vector-charmonium interactions and the nonperturbative dynamics of fully-heavy tetraquark systems."

    "abstract": "What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation. We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding."

    "abstract": "Ambient noise tomography relies on the assumption that the seismic wavefield is equipartitioned, meaning that energy is uniformly distributed among all directions. However, in practice, ambient noise sources are highly non-uniform in both spatial and temporal dimensions, resulting in biased estimation of the Green's function between stations. We introduce a data-driven method, Coherent Source Subsampling (CSS), which selects and averages only those cross-correlation time windows that are associated with the excitation of sources in the stationary-zone. By confining the ensemble average to these coherent subsets, CSS effectively mitigates the influence of anisotropic or intermittent sources and restores causal-acausal symmetry in the retrieved Green's functions. Applications to regional-scale ambient noise datasets demonstrate that CSS boosts inter-station coherence and enhances the reliability of surface-wave dispersion measurements, providing a physically interpretable bridge between source statistics and noise correlation theory."

    "abstract": "The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a robust population-transfer protocol in a driven two-level system based on a sudden sign change of the detuning at the maximum of a smooth coupling pulse. Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range. We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model."

    "abstract": "Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "Conventional Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) typically assign unique Hash IDs (HID) to construct item embeddings. These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{\\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \\name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines.

    "abstract": "High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios."

The significance of this measurement is enhanced by several new methodological improvements for isolating the rkSZ signal from primary CMB fluctuations and noise. The amplitude and shape of the signal are qualitatively consistent with predictions from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. These results establish a new tool with which to probe the dynamical state of galaxy clusters using CMB data."

However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1."

Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

    "abstract": "We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters."

Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities."

This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments.

Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications."

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x."

    "abstract": "Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods. Code: github.com/ColinQiyangLi/dqc."

Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies."

To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy.

    "abstract": "We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of $m$ goods among $n$ agents in the asymptotic setting, where each item's value for each agent is drawn from an underlying joint distribution. Prior works have shown that if this distribution is well-behaved, then an envy-free allocation exists with high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$ [Dickerson et al., 2014]. Under the stronger assumption that item values are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across agents, this requirement improves to $m=Ω(n\\log{n}/\\log{\\log{n}})$, which is tight [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2021]. However, these results rely on non-strategyproof mechanisms, such as maximum-welfare allocation or the round-robin algorithm, limiting their applicability in settings with strategic agents. In this work, we extend the theory to a broader, more realistic class of joint value distributions, allowing for correlations among agents, atomicity, and unequal probabilities of having the highest value for an item. We show that envy-free allocations continue to exist with a high probability when $m=Ω(n\\log{n})$. More importantly, we give a new randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation, efficiently implementable in polynomial time, and outputs envy-free allocations with high probability, answering an open question posed by [Manurangsi and Suksompong, 2017]. We further extend our mechanism to settings with asymptotic weighted fair division and multiple agent types and good types, proving new results in each case."

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior."

This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that the enhanced PC$^2$ has better comprehensive capability than standard PC$^2$, and is well-suited for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification tasks."

    "abstract": "Gravitons naturally acquire topological masses in the 3d topologically massive gravity (TMG) theory that includes the gravitational Chern-Simons term. We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations. With the extended massive double-copy approach, we systematically construct the graviton (dilaton) scattering amplitudesin the TMG theory from the corresponding gauge boson (adjoint scalar) amplitudes in the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory."

Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit."

Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence."

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."

We consider a minimal dark sector containing a fermion $χ$ and a complex scalar $φ$ whose only connection to the standard model is through renormalizable Yukawa interactions with right-handed Majorana neutrinos, thus realizing a neutrino portal after seesaw mixing. We discuss three representative realizations of electroweak right-handed neutrinos arising from the Type-I seesaw mechanism, spanning small, large, and ultraweak couplings to the standard model sector, so that the dark particles can either undergo secluded freeze-out or be produced via freeze-in. Instead of merely estimating the order of magnitude of the seesaw couplings, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to obtain viable seesaw parameter sets consistent with neutrino data and other constraints, and then compute the coupled evolution of the dark particles and right-handed neutrinos, reproducing the observed dark matter relic abundance in representative benchmark scenarios. For the freeze-in case, we show that internal dark sector interactions can significantly modify the predicted relic density: treating each hidden particle as an independent freeze-in component and simply adding late decays can misestimate the final dark matter abundance by $30\\%$, or even $95\\%$, depending on the type of internal interactions, compared to a full solution of the coupled Boltzmann equations for all dark species, including the dark sector temperature. Electroweak right-handed neutrino portal dark matter thus provides a robust, testable framework that tightly connects neutrino physics, collider searches for heavy neutral leptons, and the cosmological dark matter relic density, offering a well-motivated benchmark for multi-messenger probes at the high energy frontier."

Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window.

However, the possibility of implementing learning models directly at the pulse-control level remains comparatively unexplored and could offer a promising alternative. In this work, we formulate a pulse-based variant of data re-uploading, embedding trainable parameters directly into the native system's dynamics. We benchmark our approach on a simulated superconducting transmon processor with realistic noise profiles. The pulse-based model consistently outperforms its gate-based counterpart, exhibiting higher test accuracy and improved generalization under equivalent noise conditions. Moreover, by systematically increasing noise strength, we show that pulse-level implementations retain higher fidelity for longer, demonstrating enhanced resilience to decoherence and control errors. These results suggest that pulse-native architectures, though less explored, may offer a viable and hardware-aligned path forward for practical QML in the NISQ era."

RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods.

This relaxation is crucial in various real-world applications such as link prediction, community detection, and social network analysis. Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\\mathcal{O}(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $Ω(3^{\\frac{n}{3}} \\cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot 3^{\\fracδ{3}} \\cdot (δΔ)^k)$, where $δ$ is the degeneracy and $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets with more than 1 million edges demonstrate that each of our proposed algorithms for maximal $k$-defective clique enumeration and maximum $k$-defective clique search outperforms the respective state-of-the-art algorithms by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of processing time."

This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load. Integration into a five-finger robotic hand (UTRF-RoboHand) demonstrates effective object manipulation across diverse scenarios, confirming that the proposed routing achieves predictable stiffness and reliable grasping performance with a minimal actuator count."

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."

Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories."

However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set. FCResNet processes one million spectra in only 42 seconds while maintaining a simple architecture with just 348 KB model size. These results suggest that FCResNet is a practical and promising tool for processing the large volume of ultra-low-resolution spectra that will be obtained by CSST in the future."

To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data."

According to conventional chiral discrimination methods relying on static bright-dark contrast, we demonstrate an abnormal periodic chiral-reversal phenomenon retrieved through the transport of intensity equation analysis of defocus-dependent Fresnel images. Through systematic off-axis electron holography experiments and numerical simulations, we attribute these chiral misinterpretations to the sinusoidal modulation mechanism of the contrast transfer functionthat correlates with both defocus values and skyrmion dimensions. Our findings establish quantitative limitations of conventional Fresnel contrast analysis for ultrasmall skyrmions while revealing fundamental insights into defocus-mediated phase-to-intensity conversion processes in nanoscale magnetic imaging."

However, conventional FMR measurements rely on broadband vector network analyzers (VNAs), whose high cost limits accessibility for small laboratories and educational environments. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a compact and low-cost FMR measurement platform - the NanoVNA-FMR system-based on a commercially available NanoVNA. The setup integrates an electromagnet and a coplanar waveguide (CPW) and is fully automated using Python scripts. This enables synchronized magnetic-field sweeping, S-parameter acquisition, and real-time visualization. The system successfully captures clear FMR spectra that exhibit systematic shifts in resonance frequency with increasing magnetic field. The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained using a conventional VNA-based FMR system, confirming the quantitative reliability of the NanoVNA approach. Additionally, a 3D-printed sample holder further reduces overall system cost. These results demonstrate that the NanoVNA-FMR system provides a practical, accurate, and accessible alternative for quantitative magnetic characterization and educational applications."

With the exception of (100), all orientations exhibit two dimensional superconductivity, with transition temperatures Tc ranging from ~ 0.12 K to 1.9 K. This linear θ-Tc scaling is robust against variations in growth temperature, device geometry, and transport configuration. By establishing geometric orientation as a direct control knob for pairing strength, our results impose a critical benchmark for microscopic theories of superconductivity in KTaO3-based systems."

However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first work to fingerprint FL model architectures by sniffing encrypted wireless traffic, exposing a critical side-channel vulnerability in current FL systems."

Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Skyrmions and other chiral spin textures have been extensively studied as potential building blocks for novel spintronic devices. Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited."

We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics.

However, the dynamical interplay between QGP collective dynamics and jet quenching is currently poorly understood. We present a new framework for exploring dynamical correlations across momentum scales in heavy-ion collisions, based on the $p_T$-differential radial-flow observable $v_0(p_T)$. Measured $v_0(p_T)$ phenomenology is traced to the evolution in strength and coherence of distinct underlying fluctuation modes. We then propose new experimental observables to quantify this evolution. The eigenvalue ratio $λ_2/λ_1$ of the reference-aligned covariance matrix $V_0$ is shown to measure the effective fluctuation rank, while the $p_T$-dependence of the corresponding eigenvectors maps the evolution from a single coherent soft mode to multi-mode dynamics including coalescence and jet quenching. These observables map the soft-mid-hard correlation structure and provide a unified description of the collective-to-partonic transition in the QGP."

The rewards are crafted to assess music quality across three key dimensions: text alignment, audio production quality, and semantic consistency, utilizing scalable off-the-shelf models for each reward prediction. We employ these rewards in two ways: (i) By constructing preference data for DPO and (ii) by integrating the rewards into text prompting. To address the ambiguity in musicality evaluation, we propose a novel scoring mechanism leveraging semantic self-supervised representations, which significantly improves the rhythmic stability of generated music. We conduct an extensive evaluation using a variety of music-specific objective metrics as well as a human study.

We then fit a family of hierarchical probit models with global and layer-specific baselines, node- and layer-specific sociability effects, dyadic covariates, and alternative forms of latent structure (bilinear, distance-based, and stochastic block communities), comparing increasingly flexible specifications using posterior predictive checks, discrimination and calibration metrics (AUC, Brier score, log-loss), and information criteria (DIC, WAIC). Across all bands, the richest stochastic block specification attains the best predictive performance and posterior predictive fit, while revealing sparse but structured connectivity, interpretable covariate effects (notably album membership and temporal proximity), and latent communities and hubs that cut across albums and eras.

    "abstract": "Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!"

Among these textures, magnetic bubbles represent localized spin configurations that could serve as data bits. However, the precise methods for their electrical manipulation remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic electrical manipulations and detections of single magnetic bubbles in kagome-latticed Fe3Sn2 magnetic nanostructured cells. The current-induced dynamics of magnetic bubbles were explored using nanosecond pulsed currents. We show single pulsed currents with low and high densities can be applied for the creation and deletion of a single bubble, respectively. The mutual writing-deleting operations on single bubbles are attributed to the thermal heating and non-thermal spin-transfer torque effects in combination with micromagnetic simulations. We also realized the in-situ detection of a single bubble using the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect through a standard four-probe method. Our results could propel the development of bubble-based spintronic devices."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models."

The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows."

If, instead, the message had been encoded in a systematic CA-polar code, the gain improves to 0.2 ~ 1dB.

XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials."

In the latter case, the associated Aretakis instability for a massless scalar field is shifted by one order in the derivatives of the field transverse to the horizon.

Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications."

All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $μ$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array.

To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution."

Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions.

The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system."

The sensitivity as a function of the holding time can display divergence points where phase estimation becomes impossible, to which we refer as insensitivity points. We characterize their behavior as the input state, particle number, and noise operator are varied, and we find that their positions are independent of the noise intensity.

Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Our results show that our method can be used to search for sub-solar-mass, ultra-compact objects in a mass regime that remains to-date unconstrained with gravitational waves."

Our method employs precomputed histograms of momentum loss and scattering, derived from detailed Geant4 simulations, to statistically reproduce all the non-decaying physics processes during muon traversal through matter. Implemented as a CUDA kernel, the parallel algorithm enables the concurrent simulation of tens of thousands of particles on a single GPU whilst taking into account a complex geometry and a magnetic field force integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Validation against Geant4 in both simple and realistic detector geometries shows that the approach preserves key physical features while achieving speedups of several orders of magnitude, even compared to CPU-based simulations on a large CPU farm with over a thousand cores. This work highlights the significant potential of GPU-based implementations for particle transport, with applicability extending to neutrino propagation and future implementations including discrete processes such as particle decay."

    "abstract": "Proposing beneficial amino acid substitutions, whether for mutational effect prediction or protein engineering, remains a central challenge in structural biology. Recent inverse folding models, trained to reconstruct sequences from structure, have had considerable impact in identifying functional mutations. However, current approaches are constrained to designing sequences composed exclusively of natural amino acids (NAAs). The larger set of non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs), which offer greater chemical diversity, and are frequently used in in-vivo protein engineering, remain largely inaccessible for current variant effect prediction methods. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{UNAAGI}, a diffusion-based generative model that reconstructs residue identities from atomic-level structure using an E(3)-equivariant framework. By modeling side chains in full atomic detail rather than as discrete tokens, UNAAGI enables the exploration of both canonical and non-canonical amino acid substitutions within a unified generative paradigm. We evaluate our method on experimentally benchmarked mutation effect datasets and demonstrate that it achieves substantially improved performance on NCAA substitutions compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our results suggest a shared methodological foundation between protein engineering and structure-based drug design, opening the door for a unified training framework across these domains."

    "abstract": "Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design."

    "abstract": "The Babcock-Leighton dynamo, which relies on the generation of a poloidal field through the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), is a promising paradigm for explaining the features of the solar magnetic cycle. In rapidly rotating stars, BMRs are expected to emerge at high latitudes, which are less efficient in generating the poloidal field due to poor cross-equatorial cancellation. The operation of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo in rapidly rotating stars is therefore questionable. We, for the first time, using a 3D kinematic dynamo model, STABLE, explore this question. By taking large-scale flows from mean-field hydrodynamics models for stars rotating at different speeds, We conduct a series of dynamo simulations in rapidly rotating stars, exploring the following four cases of spot deposition, each based on a different assumption about toroidal flux tube rise: (i) radial rise, (ii) parallel rise to the rotation axis, (iii) parallel rise combined with an increase in Joy's law slope with the stellar rotation rate, and (iv) increasing time delay and spot size. We find cyclic magnetic fields in all cases except case IV of the 1-day rotating star, for which the magnetic field is irregular. For the parallel-rise cases, the magnetic field becomes quadrupolar, and for all other cases, it is dipolar. Our work demonstrates that the Babcock-Leighton dynamo may operate even in rapidly rotating stars with starspots appearing at higher latitudes."

We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning."

Along the analysis we obtain a duality with symplectic SQCD that can be further reduced to 3d and 2d. In the 3d case the analysis of the three sphere partition function allows one to obtain dualities between $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ with a two index symmetric tensor and $\\mathrm{SO}(N)$ theories.

We derive the conditions when almost full variable selection in the model at hand is possible and provide a selection procedure that achieves this type of selection. The procedure is adaptive to the level of sparsity described by the sparsity index $β\\in(0,1)$. We also derive conditions that make almost full variable selection in the model of our interest impossible. In view of these conditions, the proposed selector is seen to perform asymptotically optimal. The theoretical findings are illustrated numerically."

One way to address these threats is through hands-on exercises that bridge IT and OT domains to improve defensive readiness. However, consistently evaluating whether a CR platform is suitable and effective remains a challenge. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for CRs, emphasizing mission-critical settings by using a multi-criteria decision-making approach. We define a set of evaluation criteria that capture technical fidelity, training and assessment capabilities, scalability, usability, and other relevant factors. To weight and aggregate these criteria, we employ the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), supported by a simulated panel of multidisciplinary experts implemented through a Large Language Model (LLM). This LLM-assisted expert reasoning enables consistent and reproducible pairwise comparisons across criteria without requiring direct expert convening. The framework's output equals quantitative scores that facilitate objective comparison of CR platforms and highlight areas for improvement. Overall, this work lays the foundation for a standardized and explainable evaluation methodology to guide both providers and end-users of CRs."

The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions."

    "abstract": "Counting problems are fundamental across mathematics and computer science. Among the most subtle are those whose associated decision problem is solvable in polynomial time, yet whose exact counting version appears intractable. For some such problems, however, one can still obtain efficient randomized approximation in the form of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). Existing proofs of FPRAS existence are often highly technical and problem-specific, offering limited insight into a more systematic complexity-theoretic account of approximability. In this work, we propose a machine-based framework for establishing the existence of an FPRAS beyond previous uniform criteria. Our starting point is alternating computation: we introduce a counting model obtained by equipping alternating Turing machines with a transducer-style output mechanism, and we use it to define a corresponding counting class spanALP. We show that every problem in spanALP admits an FPRAS, yielding a reusable sufficient condition that can be applied via reductions to alternating logspace, polynomial-time computation with output. We situate spanALP in the counting complexity landscape as strictly between #L and TotP (assuming RP $\\neq$ NP) and observe interesting conceptual and technical gaps in the current machinery counting complexity. Moreover, as an illustrative application, we obtain an FPRAS for counting answers to counting the answers Dyck-constrained path queries in edge-labeled graphs, i.e., counting the number of distinct labelings realized by s-t walks whose label sequence is well-formed with respect to a Dyck-like language. To our knowledge, no FPRAS was previously known for this setting. We expect the alternating-transducer characterization to provide a broadly applicable tool for establishing FPRAS existence for further counting problems."

Rogue Access Point attacks, specifically the Evil Twin variant, enable attackers to clone legitimate wireless network identifiers to deceive users into connecting. Once a connection is established, the adversary can intercept traffic and harvest sensitive credentials. While modern defensive architectures often employ Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to identify malicious activity, the effectiveness of these systems against Layer 2 wireless threats remains a subject of critical inquiry. This project aimed to design a stealth-capable Rogue AP and evaluate its detectability against Suricata, an open-source NIDS/IPS. The methodology initially focused on a hardware-based deployment using Raspberry Pi platforms but transitioned to a virtualized environment due to severe system compatibility issues. Using Wifipumpkin3, the research team successfully deployed a captive portal that harvested user credentials from connected devices. However, the Suricata NIDS failed to flag the attack, highlighting a significant blind spot in traditional intrusion detection regarding wireless management frame attacks.

Scaling down the film thickness is a necessary step to prolong the lifetime of amorphous Sb, but the optical properties of Sb are also significantly altered as the thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, adding complexity to device optimization. In this work, we aim to provide atomistic understanding of the thickness-dependent optical responses in Sb thin films. As thickness decreases, both the extinction coefficient and optical contrast reduce in the near-infrared spectrum, consistent with previous optical measurements. Such thickness dependence gives rise to a bottom thickness limit of 2 nm in photonic applications, as predicted by coarse-grained device simulations. Further bonding analysis reveals a fundamentally different behavior for amorphous and crystalline Sb upon downscaling, resulting in the reduction of optical contrast. Thin film experiments are also carried out to validate our predictions. The thickness-dependent optical trend is fully demonstrated by our ellipsometric spectroscopy experiments, and the bottom thickness limit of 2 nm is confirmed by structural characterization experiments. Finally, we show that the greatly improved amorphous-phase stability of the 2 nm Sb thin film enables robust and reversible optical switching in a silicon-based waveguide device."

Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes."

Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development."

    "abstract": "The mixed quantum/classical approach of Skinner and co-workers has been widely used to calculate the line shapes of the infrared spectra of water (H2O), but less attention has been paid to the use of this approach in quantitatively calculating spectral intensity, thereby limiting direct comparisons of calculated and experimental spectra. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to facilitate direct computation of the full complex refractive index of water, replacing the normalized ordinate used in previous studies. Our results for the OH stretching region of H2O capture both the shapes and intensities of the experimental spectra. They reveal that inclusion of the local field effect is crucial to the accurate reproduction of spectral intensity. This extended approach enables new areas of analysis of the bulk, thin-film, and cluster spectra of water."

    "abstract": "Many scientific areas, from computer science to the environmental sciences and finance, give rise to multivariate time series which exhibit long memory, or loosely put, a slow decay in their autocorrelation structure. Efficient modelling and estimation in such settings is key for a number of analysis tasks, such as accurate prediction. However, traditional approaches for modelling such data, for example long memory vector autoregressive processes, are challenging even in modest dimensions, as the number of parameters grows quadratically with the number of modelled variables. Additionally, in many practical data settings, the observed series is accompanied by a (possibly inferred) network that provides information about the presence or absence of between-component associations via the graph edge topology. This article proposes two new models for capturing the dynamics of long memory time series where a network is accounted for. Our approach not only facilitates the analysis of graph-structured long memory time series, but also improves computational efficiency over traditional multivariate long memory models by leveraging the inherent low-dimensional parameter space by adapting likelihood-based estimation algorithms to the network setting. Simulation studies show that our proposed estimation is more stable than traditional models, and is able to tackle data scenarios where current models fail due to computational challenges. While widely applicable, here we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed models on datasets arising in environmental science and finance."

When such a theorem holds for operators from a Banach space $X$ into another Banach space $Y$, we say that the pair $(X,Y)$ satisfies the Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property for range strongly exposing operators (BPBp-RSE, for short). We provide new characterisations of uniform convexity and complex uniform convexity via the BPBp-RSE, including for pairs involving spaces such as $L_1(μ), L_\\infty(μ)$ and $c_0$. In particular, we show that $(L_1(μ), Y)$ satisfies the BPBp-RSE if and only if $Y$ is uniformly convex, and that $(L_\\infty(μ), Y)$ or $(c_0, Y)$ satisfy the BPBp-RSE if and only if $Y$ is $\\mathbb{C}$-uniformly convex. We also highlight differences between the real and complex cases, showing that there exist pairs $(X, Y)$ for which the BPBp-RSE holds in the complex setting but fails for their respective underlying real spaces. Additionally, we consider various subspaces of operators, such as compact and finite-rank, and extend several results from the literature to this new setting. The paper concludes with a collection of open problems."

The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $ω=(Nα)^2Υ(ε,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $α$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $Υ$ depends on the dielectric constant $ε$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs."

We find that neglecting the heat flux leads to qualitatively incorrect flow profiles, even in systems with temperature-independent viscosity. This arises from the fact that, in special relativity, the heat flux itself contributes to the momentum density (the so-called \"inertia of heat\"). This effect is most evident in the Landau frame, where the fluid removes the excess energy generated by viscous heating by streaming across the boundaries. The analysis is further extended to the limit of vanishing chemical potential."

A contrastive learning module enforces a shared embedding space to improve cross-modal alignment. Experiments on CARLA and KITTI show that TransLocNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing localization error by up to 63% and achieving sub-meter, sub-degree accuracy. These results demonstrate that TransLocNet provides robust and generalizable aerial-ground localization in both synthetic and real-world settings."

    "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new probabilistic framework for supervised learning in neural systems. It is designed to model complex, uncertain systems whose random outputs are strongly non-Gaussian given deterministic inputs. The architecture itself is a random object stochastically generated by a latent anisotropic Gaussian random field defined on a compact, boundaryless, multiply-connected manifold. The goal is to establish a novel conceptual and mathematical framework in which neural architectures are realizations of a geometry-aware, field-driven generative process. Both the neural topology and synaptic weights emerge jointly from a latent random field. A reduced-order parameterization governs the spatial intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process on the manifold, from which neuron locations are sampled. Input and output neurons are identified via extremal evaluations of the latent field, while connectivity is established through geodesic proximity and local field affinity. Synaptic weights are conditionally sampled from the field realization, inducing stochastic output responses even for deterministic inputs. To ensure scalability, the architecture is sparsified via percentile-based diffusion masking, yielding geometry-aware sparse connectivity without ad hoc structural assumptions. Supervised learning is formulated as inference on the generative hyperparameters of the latent field, using a negative log-likelihood loss estimated through Monte Carlo sampling from single-observation-per-input datasets. The paper initiates a mathematical analysis of the model, establishing foundational properties such as well-posedness, measurability, and a preliminary analysis of the expressive variability of the induced stochastic mappings, which support its internal coherence and lay the groundwork for a broader theory of geometry-driven stochastic learning."

We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched \"on\" and \"off\" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures."

Here the pseudo-binary (SiC)(AlN) alloy is studied from first-principles over the entire composition range. Relevant crystalline phases are identified using the First-Principles Random Structure Sampling approach which, in accordance with previous bulk experiments, finds wurtzite, zincblende and rhombohedral phases to be the only statistically relevant phases of the alloy. Further study of these phases is done through Special Quasi-random Structures (SQS) and, in the case of the wurtzite phase, predictions of the stiffness, piezoelectric and dielectric tensors. Analysis of these tensors is done through the scope of a Bulk AcousticWave (BAW) filter application, where trends and trade-offs between the c-axis acoustic velocity and piezoelectric response enable identification of relevant compositions."

However, evaluating the quality of audio captions remains a major challenge, especially in reference-free settings where high-quality ground-truth captions are unavailable. While CLAPScore is currently the most widely used reference-free Audio Caption Evaluation Metric(ACEM), its robustness under diverse conditions has not been systematically validated. To address this gap, we introduce BRACE, a new benchmark designed to evaluate audio caption alignment quality in a reference-free setting. BRACE is primarily designed for assessing ACEMs, and can also be extended to measure the modality alignment abilities of Large Audio Language Model(LALM). BRACE consists of two sub-benchmarks: BRACE-Main for fine-grained caption comparison and BRACE-Hallucination for detecting subtle hallucinated content. We construct these datasets through high-quality filtering, LLM-based corruption, and human annotation. Given the widespread adoption of CLAPScore as a reference-free ACEM and the increasing application of LALMs in audio-language tasks, we evaluate both approaches using the BRACE benchmark, testing CLAPScore across various CLAP model variants and assessing multiple LALMs. Notably, even the best-performing CLAP-based ACEM achieves only a 70.01 F1-score on the BRACE-Main benchmark, while the best LALM reaches just 63.19. By revealing the limitations of CLAP models and LALMs, our BRACE benchmark offers valuable insights into the direction of future research."

The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors."

Combining dissimilar materials offers opportunities to create several functional heterostructures. Yet, assessing structural compatibility (the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth) is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters/crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end we implemented developments tailored for the efficient prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and using a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically extracted from the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface and assign a structure to many other reported metal halide/oxide based interfaces.

In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work.

To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods."

This yields a sharp upper bound on the spectral radius in terms of vertex weights, along with a lower bound on the multiplicity at which this bound is attained. Second, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap and characterize when the equality holds. Third, explicit lower bounds for the remaining eigenvalues are derived, linking the vertex-weighted Laplacian spectrum to that of a related weighted graph. Finally, we reveal new spectral relations between a simplicial complex and its subcomplexes.

Differing from traditional genetic programming approaches, the SMC-based algorithm combines probabilistic selection, adaptive tempering, and the use of normalized marginal likelihood to efficiently explore the search space of symbolic expressions, yielding parsimonious expressions with improved generalization. When compared to standard genetic programming baselines, the proposed method better deals with challenging, noisy benchmark datasets. The reduced tendency to overfit and enhanced ability to discover accurate and interpretable equations paves the way for more robust symbolic regression in scientific discovery and engineering design applications."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that enables controllable and diverse player behaviors without relying on human gameplay data. Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games."

    "abstract": "Let $k \\ge 1$ be an integer and let $G$ be a nonempty simple graph. An \\emph{edge-$k$-coloring} $\\varphi$ of $G$ is an assignment of colors from $\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. For a vertex $v \\in V(G)$, we write $\\varphi(v)$ for the set of colors assigned to the edges incident with $v$. The coloring $\\varphi$ is called \\emph{vertex-distinguishing} if $\\varphi(u) \\ne \\varphi(v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v \\in V(G)$. A vertex-distinguishing edge-$k$-coloring exists if and only if $G$ has at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge. The least integer $k$ for which such a coloring exists is called the \\emph{vertex-distinguishing chromatic index} of $G$, denoted $χ'_{vd}(G)$. In 1997, Burris and Schelp conjectured that for every graph $G$ with at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge, $ k(G) \\;\\le\\; χ'_{vd}(G) \\;\\le\\; k(G)+1$, where $k(G)$ is the natural lower bound required for a vertex-distinguishing coloring in $G$. In 2004, Balister, Kostochka, Li, and Schelp verified the conjecture for graphs $G$ satisfying $Δ(G) \\ge \\sqrt{2|V(G)|} + 4 $ and $δ(G) \\ge 5$. For graphs that do not satisfy these conditions, the best known general upper bound on $χ'_{vd}(G)$ remains $|V(G)| + 1$, established in 1999 by Bazgan, Harkat-Benhamdine, Li, and Woźniak. In this paper, we prove that $χ'_{vd}(G) \\le \\floor{5.5k(G)+6.5}$, which represents a substantial improvement over the bound $|V(G)| + 1$ whenever $k(G) = o(|V(G)|)$. We further show that $χ'_{vd}(G) \\le k(G) + 3$, for all $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d \\ge \\log_2 |V(G)|\\geq 8$."

As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios. This study advances quantum optimization and lays groundwork for future large-scale applications."

Specifically, an $(α, β)$-SLT of $G$ w.r.t. $s \\in V$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with root-stretch $α$ (preserving all distances between $s$ and the other vertices up to a factor of $α$) and lightness $β$ (its weight is at most $β$ times the weight of a minimum spanning tree of $G$). Despite the large body of work on SLTs, the basic question of whether a better approximation algorithm exists was left untouched to date, and this holds in any graph family. This paper makes a first nontrivial step towards this question by presenting two bicriteria approximation algorithms. For any $ε>0$, a set $P$ of $n$ points in constant-dimensional Euclidean space and a source $s\\in P$, our first (respectively, second) algorithm returns, in $O(n \\log n \\cdot {\\rm polylog}(1/ε))$ time, a non-Steiner (resp., Steiner) tree with root-stretch $1+O(ε\\log ε^{-1})$ and weight at most $O(\\mathrm{opt}_ε\\cdot \\log^2 ε^{-1})$ (resp., $O(\\mathrm{opt}_ε\\cdot \\log ε^{-1})$), where $\\mathrm{opt}_ε$ denotes the minimum weight of a non-Steiner (resp., Steiner) tree with root-stretch $1+ε$."

For finite $N_c$, we derive lower bounds on the second and fourth multipoles of the energy-energy correlator at different couplings, along with a smeared energy-energy correlator as a function of the angle between the two detectors. We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively. A similar phenomenon occurs in QCD, where a parton-hadron transition is observed as detectors are brought closer together."

Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management."

One of these challenges is identifying the right semiconductor/insulator combination that ensures high performance, stability, and reliability. In contrast to conventional 2D interfaces, which suffer from van der Waals gaps or covalent bonding issues, zippered structures such as the high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and its native high-$κ$ oxide Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ offer high-quality interfaces, good scalability, and excellent device performance. While most prior work has focused mainly on basic device behavior, here we also thoroughly assess the stability and reliability of this material system using a multiscale approach that integrates electrical characterization, density functional theory, and TCAD simulations, linking atomistic states to device-scale reliability. By analyzing four transistor design generations (top-gated, fin, and two gate-all-around FETs), we provide realistic predictions for how this system performs at the ultimate scaling limit. We identify oxygen-related defects in the oxide as the main contributors to hysteresis and recoverable threshold shifts, and we propose mitigation strategies through encapsulation or oxygen-rich annealing. Benchmarking the extracted material parameters against IRDS 2037 requirements, we demonstrate that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors can achieve high drain and low gate currents at ultra-scaled conditions. These findings position this material system as a technologically credible and manufacturing-relevant pathway for future nanoelectronics."

These calculi provide a modal logical foundation for various strong functors in typed-functional programming.

    "abstract": "The surface densities of star formation, Sigma_SFR, in 24 dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey are combined with gas surface densities and midplane pressures to examine the correlations found previously for spiral galaxies. The pressure is the weight of the disk inside the gas layer, including gas, stars, and dark matter, which usually dominates disk gravity in dIrrs. We compare the results to the outer part of M33, which has similar local properties but a slightly higher metallicity, enabling the detection of CO. All the data are convolved to the HI beam, but to study the effects of resolution, the galaxies are examined first with average radial profiles, and then with maps having 1.5\" pixels and 244 pc pixels. The correlations are found to be independent of resolution from 24 pc to 424 pc. The average ratio of molecular to atomic surface density is estimated to be 0.23+-0.1, from the H_2 surface density in M33 compared to the HI surface density at the same Sigma_SFR in the dIrrs. With this ratio, the average star formation rate per molecule is about the same for all the dIrrs, and a factor of 2 less than the rate in M33. The pressure in dIrrs is so low that CO is essentially a dense gas tracer, with the same surface density threshold at the low metallicities of dIrrs as HCN has in spiral galaxies. As a result, CO regions in dIrrs should be strongly self-gravitating."

We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests."

Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration."

However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows.

To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches.

Our analysis shows that bots relied disproportionately on retweets and replies, with reply activity spiking after the 2018 election, suggesting tactics of conversational infiltration and amplification. Sentiment analysis indicates that bots maintained a narrower emotional tone, in contrast to humans, whose sentiment fluctuated more strongly with political events.

We advanced our previously proposed physiology-centered hybrid AI method-Physiological Model-Based Neural Network (PMB-NN)-in blood pressure estimation, that unifies deep learning with a 2-element Windkessel based model parameterized by R and C acting as physics constraints. The PMB-NN model was trained in a subject-specific manner using PPG-derived timing features, while demographic information was used to infer an intermediate variable: cardiac output. We validated the model on 10 healthy adults performing static and cycling activities across two days for model's day-to-day robustness, benchmarked against deep learning (DL) models (FCNN, CNN-LSTM, Transformer) and standalone Windkessel based physiological model (PM). Validation was conducted on three perspectives: accuracy, interpretability and plausibility. PMB-NN achieved systolic BP accuracy (MAE: 7.2 mmHg) comparable to DL benchmarks, diastolic performance (MAE: 3.9 mmHg) lower than DL models. However, PMB-NN exhibited higher physiological plausibility than both DL baselines and PM, suggesting that the hybrid architecture unifies and enhances the respective merits of physiological principles and data-driven techniques. Beyond BP, PMB-NN identified R (ME: 0.15 mmHg$\\cdot$s/ml) and C (ME: -0.35 ml/mmHg) during training with accuracy similar to PM, demonstrating that the embedded physiological constraints confer interpretability to the hybrid AI framework. These results position PMB-NN as a balanced, physiologically grounded alternative to purely data-driven approaches for daily hemodynamic monitoring."

For that, instead of choosing a specific model for the matter power spectrum, the main ingredient of these probes, we express it by parametrizing its components, such as the expansion and the growth factor, and those of the standard halo model and excursion set theory in several z bins, besides to the different bias and non-linear bias modelling functions. We apply the technique to Euclid, Rubin and SKA public specifications in the range 0.2 < z < 1.8 and show that one can then obtain model-independent constraints of the expansion E(z i ) and the growth factor G(z i ). We also show the change in gain in precision at each z- shell when going from pessimistic cut at linear scales to more optimistic non-linear settings, or the difference between using each survey alone or a combination of all of them, or the impact from fixing or adding more degrees of freedom in the non-linear modeling. We found that, in the most agnostic case, one can still reach high precision on E(z i ) in the order of the percent level when combining the three surveys at once while the growth factor G(z i ) has for the same settings one order of magnitude weaker constraints. We also found for both factors, an improvement that can reach one order of magnitude in precision when passing from linear to non-linear scales. We conclude that we will be able to constrain the two important factors of the background evolution and structure formation of the Universe when using non linear scales and the combined power of future surveys even in the most agnostic approaches."

These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches."

However, in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX, the time source is outside the Trusted Computing Base: a malicious host can manipulate the TEE's notion of time, jumping in time or affecting perceived time speed. Previous work (Triad) proposes protocols for TEEs to maintain a trustworthy time source by building a cluster of TEEs that collaborate with each other and with a remote Time Authority to maintain a continuous notion of passing time. However, such approaches still allow an attacker to control the operating system and arbitrarily manipulate their own TEE's perceived clock speed. An attacker can even propagate faster passage of time to honest machines participating in Triad's trusted time protocol, causing them to skip to timestamps arbitrarily far in the future. We propose TriHaRd, a TEE trusted time protocol achieving high resilience against clock speed and offset manipulations, notably through Byzantine-resilient clock updates and consistency checks. We empirically show that TriHaRd mitigates known attacks against Triad."

    "abstract": "Deep generative models, while revolutionizing fields like image and text generation, largely operate as opaque black boxes, hindering human understanding, control, and alignment. While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization. Furthermore, these causally grounded concepts serve as levers for fine-grained model steering, paving the way for transparent, reliable systems."

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods."

The approximate N$^2$LO corrections consist of the large logarithmic terms $\\ln^n (1-Q^2/\\hat{s})$ (with $\\sqrt{\\hat{s}}$ being the partonic center-of-mass energy and $Q$ the invariant mass of the $tW$ system) and the terms proportional to $δ(1-Q^2/\\hat{s})$ at $\\mathcal{O}(α_s^2)$, which are obtained by utilizing the newly obtained two-loop hard and soft functions. The approximate N$^3$LO corrections further include the large logarithms at $\\mathcal{O}(α_s^3)$ by using renormalization group evolution equations and the three-loop soft anomalous dimension, while the $δ(1-Q^2/\\hat{s})$ term is only partially accurate at this order. Numerical evaluation reveals that they increase the NLO cross section by more than $10\\%$. The inclusion of these higher-order corrections leads to improved agreement with the experimental data at the LHC, resulting in a direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{tb}|=0.99\\pm 0.03({\\rm exp.})\\pm 0.03({\\rm theo.})$ without assuming unitarity of the matrix."

We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $Φ^4\\_2$ non-linear Schr{ö}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity.

The proof in [9] made use of the positive resolution of the surface subgroup conjecture [15].

    "abstract": "It is generally appreciated that a frequentist analysis of a group sequential trial must in order to avoid inflating type I error account for the fact that one or more interim analyses were performed. It is also to a lesser extent realised that it may be necessary to account for the ensuing estimation bias. A group sequential design is an instance of adaptive clinical trials where a study may change its design dynamically as a reaction to the observed data. There is a widespread perception that one may circumvent the statistical issues associated with the analysis of an adaptive clinical trial by performing the analysis under a Bayesian paradigm. The root of the argument is that the Bayesian posterior is perceived as unaltered by the data-driven adaptations. We examine this claim by analysing a simple trial with a single interim analysis. We approach the interpretation of the trial data under both a frequentist and Bayesian paradigm with a focus on estimation. The conventional result is that the interim analysis impacts the estimation procedure under the frequentist paradigm, but not under the Bayesian paradigm, which may be seen as expressing a \"paradox\" between the two paradigms. We argue that this result however relies heavily on what one would define as the universe of relevant trials defined by first samples of the parameters from a prior distribution and then the data from a sampling model given the parameters. In particular, in this set of trials, whether a connection exists between the parameter of interest and design parameters. We show how an alternative interpretation of the trial yields a Bayesian posterior mean that corrects for the interim analysis with a term that closely resembles the frequentist conditional bias. We conclude that the role of auxiliary trial parameters needs to be carefully considered when constructing a prior in an adaptive design."

In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $τ_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR."

    "abstract": "Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant \"popularity direction\" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

Currently, efficient SMLM requires non-overlapping emitting fluorophores, leading to long acquisition times that hinders live-cell imaging. Recent deep-learning approaches can handle denser emissions, but they rely on variants of non-maximum suppression (NMS) layers, which are unfortunately non-differentiable and may discard true positives with their local fusion strategy. In this presentation, we reformulate the SMLM training objective as a set-matching problem, deriving an optimal-transport loss that eliminates the need for NMS during inference and enables end-to-end training. Additionally, we propose an iterative neural network that integrates knowledge of the microscope's optical system inside our model.

However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment."

In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover."

The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance.

We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems."

To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field."

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance."

    "abstract": "The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient. We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input."

    "abstract": "Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks."

While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling."

Such systems with $n \\geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed."

OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition.

We study the problem both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. In Euclidean signature, we show that, similarly to the Einstein gravity case, the entropy at large temperatures exhibits the behavior of a conformal field theory in one lower dimension. We also show that in the flat space limit, the higher curvature corrections do not contribute to the leading behavior at high temperatures. We conjecture that this result is a universal feature of the flat space limit in the presence of conformal boundaries. We test our conjecture by analyzing charged black holes. In Lorentzian signature, we analyze the dynamics of the boundary Weyl factor in black hole backgrounds at the linearized level."

Our starting point is the complexity class $\\textsf{NBQP}$ (\"noisy BQP\"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques."

While volatile ratios such as carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) are used to trace formation location, the rock-forming elements - magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) - govern interior mineralogy and are commonly assumed to reflect the host star's abundances. Yet this assumption remains largely untested. Ultra-hot Jupiters, gas-giant exoplanets with dayside temperatures above 3000 K, provide rare access to refractory elements that remain gaseous. Here we present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-189b (Teq = 3354^{+27}_{-34} K) obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on Gemini South. We detect neutral iron (Fe I), magnesium (Mg I), silicon (Si I), water (H_2O), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydroxyl (OH) at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 4, and retrieve their elemental abundances. We show that the Mg/Si, Fe/Mg, and Si/Fe ratios are consistent with stellar values, while the refractory-to-volatile ratio is enhanced by roughly a factor of ~2. These findings demonstrate that giant-planet atmospheres can preserve stellar-like rock-forming ratios, providing an empirical validation of the stellar-proxy assumption that underpins planetary composition and formation models across exoplanet systems."

Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work."

Although the extinction of either species can be achieved by excessive culling, choosing a harvesting strategy such that the biodiversity of the populations is preserved is much more complicated. We propose a type of heterogeneous harvesting policy, dependent on dispersal strategy, where the two managed populations become an ideal free pair, and show that this strategy guarantees the coexistence of the species. We also show that if the harvesting of one of the populations is perturbed in some way, then it is possible for the coexistence to be preserved. Further, we show that if the dispersal of two species formed an ideal free pair, then a slight change in the dispersal strategy for one of them does not affect their ability to coexist. Finally, in the model, directed movement is represented by the term $Δ(u/P)$, where $P$ is the dispersal strategy and target distribution. We justify that once an invading species, which has an advantage in carrying capacity, chooses a dispersal strategy that mimics the resident species distribution, then successful invasion is guaranteed. However, numerical simulations show that invasion may be successful even without an advantage in carrying capacity. More work is needed to understand the conditions, in addition to targeted culling, under which the host species would be able to persist through an invasion."

Beyond their interpretability benefits, counterfactuals can also be leveraged for model reconstruction, where a surrogate model is trained to replicate the behavior of a target model. In this work, we demonstrate that model reconstruction can be significantly improved by recognizing that counterfactuals, which typically lie close to the decision boundary, can serve as informative though less representative samples for both classes. This is particularly beneficial in settings with limited access to labeled data. We propose a method that integrates original data samples with counterfactuals to approximate class prototypes using the Wasserstein barycenter, thereby preserving the underlying distributional structure of each class. This approach enhances the quality of the surrogate model and mitigates the issue of decision boundary shift, which commonly arises when counterfactuals are naively treated as ordinary training instances.

However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint."

The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $αφ$ and $α$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $φ$ meson exhibits a strong \"glue-like\" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $α$-$α$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/ψ$ and $η_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $α$-$α$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $α$-$J/ψ$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{9}_{J/ψ}{\\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{9}_φ{\\text{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $α$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play.

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations."

On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios. This work provides a reproducible data foundation, evaluation standard and extensible technical framework for reliability research in smart-home voice interaction."

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C."

However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios."

We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $ω$ and $\\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\\Im (ω,\\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(ω,\\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $ω\\cdot \\Im G(ω,\\vec k) \\ge 0$ for real $(ω,\\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\\Im [ω\\, G(ω,\\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $ε(ω,k)$ and $μ^{-1}(ω,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \\to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed."

In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method. Our proposed method can be used with each of the following three risks: the mean squared error, the negative reward (which relates to the explained variance), and the regret (which quantifies the excess risk relative to the best predictor). For MaxRM with regret as the risk, we prove a novel out-of-sample guarantee over unseen test distributions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data."

Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space."

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers will need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks through normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks."

We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments.

Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions."

A combined analysis shows that the branching ratios and asymmetry parameters of the decay channels $Λ\\to pπ^-$ and $Σ^\\pm\\to Nπ$ can be well described in the same framework with the direct pion emission, color suppressed internal $W$ emission, and pole terms included. However, the channel $Λ\\to nπ^0$ indicates significant deviations from the experimental data based on these mentioned transition mechanism. We demonstrate that the final state interactions (FSIs) via the coupled-channel rescatterings play a crucial role in $Λ\\to nπ^0$. Namely, the dominant decay channel of $Λ\\to pπ^-$ can contribute to $Λ\\to nπ^0$ via the $pπ^-\\to nπ^0$ rescatterings. This is a leading correction effect for $Λ\\to nπ^0$ at the one-loop level. We find that such FSIs only become the leading effects in $Λ\\to nπ^0$, but contribute as subleading contributions in other channels. We also demonstrate that the pole terms are indispensable in these hyperon decays. In particular, for $Σ^-\\to nπ^-$ and $Σ^+\\to nπ^+$, it shows that $Λ(1405)$ as the intermediate state in the pole term amplitude is necessary for reproducing the experimental data. We also find that a dynamic selection rule forbids the radial excitation state $N(1710)$ of the quark model multiplet $|70, ^28,2,0^+,1/2^+\\rangle$ from contribution. To some extent, the hyperon hadronic weak decays serve as a special probe for the underlying transition mechanisms and can provide some constraints on the intermediate $J^P=1/2^\\pm$ baryon resonances."

Data for the research are field-based and were obtained from a total of 600 SMEs operating in both countries. Based on the questionnaires' responses by 294 managers, results from the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) have indicated significant positive effects of AI-TOE on environmental performance (beta = 0.487) and manufacturing performance (beta = 0.759). Results indicate that AI acts as a transformative force, though its impact differs based on the maturity of infrastructure and organizational readiness. The Saudi SMEs gain from their institutional support and advanced technologies, while those in Yemen are dependent on the low-cost adoption of AI and organizational flexibility to accept structural challenges. PLS-SEM analysis of the study showed that integrating AI into the TOE dimensions accelerates operational efficiency in order to support environmental performance. Industrial performance was found to be a very important mediator in this relationship. This study responds to the call for digital transformation literature by providing an actionable framework of AI adoption in resource-constrained environments. These findings offer insights that might guide policymakers and organizations toward more resilient and sustainable operational strategies. These findings provide valuable guidance for engineering managers within the context of negotiating digital transformation and sustainability trade-offs in fragile and resource-constrained contexts."

To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet."

    "abstract": "Nonlinear inverse problems often feature noisy, non-differentiable, or expensive residual evaluations that make Jacobian-based solvers unreliable. Popular derivative-free optimizers such as natural evolution strategies (NES) or Powell's NEWUOA still assume smoothness or expend many evaluations to maintain stability. Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) relies on empirical covariances that require preconditioning and scale poorly with residual dimension. We introduce residual subspace evolution strategies (RSES), a derivative-free solver that samples Gaussian probes around the current iterate, builds a residual-only surrogate from their differences, and recombines the probes through a least-squares solve yielding an optimal update without forming Jacobians or covariances. Each iteration costs $k+1$ residual evaluations, where $k \\ll n$ for $n$-dimensional problems, with $O(k^3)$ linear algebra overhead. Benchmarks on calibration, regression, and deconvolution problems demonstrate consistent misfit reduction in both deterministic and stochastic settings. RSES matches or surpasses xNES and NEWUOA while staying competitive with EKI under matched evaluation budgets, particularly when smoothness or covariance assumptions fail."

We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schlögl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general."

    "abstract": "In complex systems, groups of interacting objects may form prevalent and persistent spatiotemporal patterns, which we refer to as motifs. These motifs can exhibit features that reveal how individual objects interact with one another. Simultaneously, the motifs can also interact, causing new coarse-grained properties to emerge in the system. In this paper, we found motifs in a simulated system of Dynamically Self-Organising cells. We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters). We speculate that this concept of motif hierarchies may be applied broadly to many-body interacting systems that are otherwise too complex to understand."

While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively."

Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control."

Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars."

    "abstract": "Concavity and its refinements underpin tractability in multiplayer games, where players independently choose actions to maximize their own payoffs which depend on other players' actions. In concave games, where players' strategy sets are compact and convex, and their payoffs are concave in their own actions, strong guarantees follow: Nash equilibria always exist and decentralized algorithms converge to equilibria. If the game is furthermore monotone, an even stronger guarantee holds: Nash equilibria are unique under strictness assumptions. Unfortunately, we show that certifying concavity or monotonicity is NP-hard, already for games where utilities are multivariate polynomials and compact, convex basic semialgebraic strategy sets -- an expressive class that captures extensive-form games with imperfect recall. On the positive side, we develop two hierarchies of sum-of-squares programs that certify concavity and monotonicity of a given game, and each level of the hierarchies can be solved in polynomial time. We show that almost all concave/monotone games are certified at some finite level of the hierarchies. Subsequently, we introduce SOS-concave/monotone games, which globally approximate concave/monotone games, and show that for any given game we can compute the closest SOS-concave/monotone game in polynomial time. Finally, we apply our techniques to canonical examples of imperfect recall extensive-form games."

This value emerges as a geometric attractor identified from exactly 18 primitive triangle families, whose completeness is supported by Diophantine constraints and extensive computational searches. The methodology connects three classical mathematical frameworks: De Moivre s theorem (1707), Chebyshev polynomials (1854), and results on the finiteness of integral points. Extended searches expanding the parameter space by a factor of 15 yield no new families, confirming saturation. The constant V0 connects to the Koide formula through Delta = 2/3 - V0 and approximates cos(13*pi/48) to 0.06 percent, suggesting links to cyclotomic fields. Using only dimensionless quantities, we obtain the electron anomaly ae with precision 0.15 ppb, the muon anomaly a_mu with 17 ppb, and the tau anomaly a_tau with 3.4 ppm. The framework is phenomenological and does not claim a derivation from quantum field theory, but its mathematical constraints yield testable predictions for future precision measurements."

A special member of this family, obtained using the two-parameter Burr XII distribution as the baseline, is developed and examined in detail. Several analytical properties of the proposed alpha power Harris Burr XII (APHBXII) model are derived, which include closed-form expressions for its moments, mean and median deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, order statistics, and Renyi and Tsallis entropies. Parameter estimation is performed via maximum likelihood, and a Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of the estimators. In addition, three real lifetime datasets are analyzed to evaluate the empirical performance of the APHBXII distribution relative to four competing models. The results show that the five-parameter APHBXII model provides superior fit across all datasets, as supported by model-selection criteria and goodness-of-fit statistics."

Despite this leadership, limited research has examined gender disparities in scientific publishing within the Canadian context. This study analyzes over 67,000 articles published in 24 Canadian Science Publishing (CSP) journals between 2010 and 2021 to better understand patterns of gender representation. Findings show that women accounted for less than one-third of published authors across CSP journals. Representation varied by discipline, with higher proportions of women in biomedical sciences and lower proportions of women in engineering - trends that mirror broader national and global patterns. Notably, the proportion of women submitting manuscripts closely matched those published, suggesting that broader workforce disparities may play a larger role than publication bias. Women were less likely to be solo authors or to hold prominent authorship positions, such as first or last author - roles typically associated with research leadership and career advancement. These findings point to the need for a two-fold response: continued efforts to address systemic barriers to women's participation in science, and a review of publishing practices to ensure equitable access, recognition, and inclusion for all researchers."

Long-LRM notably scales this paradigm to 32 input images at $950\\times540$ resolution, achieving 360° scene-level reconstruction in a single forward pass. However, directly predicting millions of Gaussian parameters at once remains highly error-sensitive: small inaccuracies in positions or other attributes lead to noticeable blurring, particularly in fine structures such as text. In parallel, implicit representation methods such as LVSM and LaCT have demonstrated significantly higher rendering fidelity by compressing scene information into model weights rather than explicit Gaussians, and decoding RGB frames using the full transformer or TTT backbone. However, this computationally intensive decompression process for every rendered frame makes real-time rendering infeasible. These observations raise key questions: Is the deep, sequential \"decompression\" process necessary? Can we retain the benefits of implicit representations while enabling real-time performance? We address these questions with Long-LRM++, a model that adopts a semi-explicit scene representation combined with a lightweight decoder. Long-LRM++ matches the rendering quality of LaCT on DL3DV while achieving real-time 14 FPS rendering on an A100 GPU, overcoming the speed limitations of prior implicit methods. Our design also scales to 64 input views at the $950\\times540$ resolution, demonstrating strong generalization to increased input lengths. Additionally, Long-LRM++ delivers superior novel-view depth prediction on ScanNetv2 compared to direct depth rendering from Gaussians. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework."

Here, through systematic frst-principles investigations of all intrinsic point defects, we identify a practical route to achieving stable and ideal topological characteristics in ZrTe5. We show that the competition between two dominant charged defects, donor-like Zr interstitials and acceptor-like Te vacancies, governs the Fermi-level position. Furthermore, variations in defect density determine the topological phases of the samples. We theoretically propose and experimentally confrm that increasing the Te/Zr ratio during crystal growth effectively suppresses intrinsic defects and stabilizes ZrTe5 in a nearly ideal weak topological insulator state. These fndings provide clear guidance for defect control and sample optimization, paving the way toward robust and reproducible realization of topological quantum states in ZrTe5 for future quantum applications."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for iterative methods of solving nonlinear inverse scattering problems with a fixed frequency.

Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research."

    "abstract": "This work investigates exploiting the potential of pixel antennas, which are a reconfigurable antenna technology that can flexibly adjust the antenna characteristics through antenna coding, in multi-user transmissions. To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas. More importantly, results validate that the proposed (hierarchical) codebook-based algorithms can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining a satisfactory sum rate performance."

    "abstract": "Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas."

Second, we empirically characterize developer workflows in both traditional and AI-augmented systems. Third, we automate cognitively demanding resolution tasks, including buggy UI localization and solution identification, through ML, DL, and LLM-based approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Contextual Reward Machine for task-oriented grasping. The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings."

    "abstract": "Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance."

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines."

We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so. Our results show that integrated photon subtraction and catalysis enable practical, chip-compatible generation of non-Gaussian entanglement suitable for advanced quantum teleportation and continuous-variable quantum networks."

They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference."

    "abstract": "Quantum process tomography, the task of estimating an unknown quantum channel, is a central problem in quantum information theory and a key primitive for characterising noisy quantum devices. A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance."

Standard approaches such as complete-case analysis, single-value substitution, and parametric Tobit-type models are either inefficient or sensitive to distributional misspecification. We study semiparametric rank-based regression models as robust alternatives to parametric mean-based counterparts for censored responses under detection limits. Our focus is on accelerated failure time (AFT) type formulations, where rank-based estimating equations yield consistent slope estimates without specifying the error distribution. We develop a unifying simulation framework that generates left- and right-censored data under several data-generating mechanisms, including normal, Weibull, and log-normal error structures, with detection limits or administrative censoring calibrated to target censoring rates between 10\\% and 60\\%. Across scenarios, we compare semiparametric AFT estimators with parametric Weibull AFT, Tobit, and Cox proportional hazards models in terms of bias, empirical variability, and relative efficiency. Numerical results show that parametric models perform well only under correct specification, whereas rank-based semiparametric AFT estimators maintain near-unbiased covariate effects and stable precision even under heavy censoring and distributional misspecification. These findings support semiparametric rank-based regression as a practical default for censored regression with detection limits when the error distribution is uncertain.

This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy.

Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions.

Using these bounds, we prove a sharp contrast: strategyproofness in the large holds if and only if each principal's share of identities vanishes, whereas any principal with a persistent positive share can construct deviations yielding strictly positive limiting gains. We further show that the feasibility of BRACE fails in the event of an unbounded population of Sybils and provide a precise cost threshold that ensures disincentivization of such attacks in large markets."

Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL."

    "abstract": "Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information."

    "abstract": "In practical deep learning deployment, the scarcity of data and the imbalance of label distributions often lead to semantically uncovered regions within the real-world data distribution, hindering model training and causing misclassification near class boundaries as well as unstable behaviors in peripheral areas. Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data."

    "abstract": "Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions."

This paper proposes spectral decompositions of the controllability Gramian and its inverse based on system eigenvalues for a continuous LTI dynamical system in the controllability canonical (companion) form. The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction."

The brain, with its characteristic sublinear scaling of activity, has long posed a puzzle: why do larger brains operate with disproportionately lower firing rates? Here we show that this economy of scale is a universal outcome of avalanche dynamics. We derive analytical scaling laws directly from avalanche statistics, establishing that any system governed by critical avalanches must exhibit sublinear activity-size relations. This theoretical prediction is then verified in integrate-and-fire neuronal networks at criticality and in classical self-organized criticality models, demonstrating that the effect is not model-specific but generic. The predicted exponents align with experimental observations across mammal species, bridging dynamical criticality with the allometry of brain metabolism. Our results reveal avalanche criticality as a fundamental mechanism underlying Kleiber-like scaling in the brain."

However, since the signal of interest (SI) of a wireless communication system acts as estimation noise, i.e., interference, to KIC, the SI limits the extent to which the known interference (KI) can be canceled and that in turn limits the throughput of the wireless communication system that is being hidden or secured. In this letter, we analyze a decision feedback-aided known-interference cancellation (DF-KIC) structure in which both the KI and SI are canceled iteratively and successively. Measurement results demonstrate that introducing decision feedback to KIC improves its KI cancellation capability and hence increases the wireless communication system's useful throughput, albeit at the expense of a higher computational load."

The algorithm iteratively and explicitly adjusts its estimates of the channel and frequency offsets using stochastic gradient descent-based rules and the step sizes of these rules determine the learning rate and stability of the algorithm. Within the stability conditions, the choice of step sizes reflects a trade-off between the algorithm's ability to react to changes in the channel and the ability to minimize misadjustments caused by noise. This paper provides theoretical expressions to predict and optimize the tracking and misadjusment errors of FO-LMS when estimating channels and frequency offsets with known time-varying characteristics. This work also proposes a method to adjust the FO-LMS's step sizes based on the algorithm's performance when the time-varying characteristics are not known, which is more often the case in practice. Accuracy of the expressions and performance of the proposed variable step sizes algorithm are studied through simulations."

Properties of generalized Spearman correlation are investigated when the functions are piecewise continuous and strictly monotonic, with particular focus on the special cases where the functions are drawn from orthonormal bases defined by Legendre polynomials and cosine functions. For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated. Potential applications of the theory are demonstrated including: exploratory analyses of the dependence structures of datasets and their symmetries; elicitation of functions maximizing generalized Spearman correlation via expansions in orthonormal basis functions; and construction of tractable probability densities to model a wide variety of non-monotonic dependencies."

Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \\emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency."

We investigate two parametrisations of this modification, both proportional to a new parameter $A_c$, which is assumed to be either constant in time, or proportional to the scale factor $a$, in order to be more relevant at late times. We find DES and ISW data to be consistent with the standard continuity equation when $A_c$ is constant, but 2--3$σ$ hints of a non-zero modification appear when Planck data is included. The model $A_c \\propto a$ results in stronger tensions. We also test the effects of including the common extra parameters $μ$ and $η$ that modify the Poisson equation and Weyl potential. Although $A_c$, $μ$ and $η$ are correlated, we still find non-zero $A_c$ when Planck data is included or without Planck if $A_c \\propto a$ and only either $η$ or $μ$ are allowed to vary. We conclude that violations of the continuity equation should be considered with care when testing additional deviations from general relativity."

High-fidelity numerical simulations using compressible unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) are conducted to investigate the mean and temporal features resulting from mass injection into an S-shaped diffuser with differing injection speeds and pulse frequencies. The results are compared with experiments to confirm the accuracy of the numerical solution. Overall, 2-D simulations are relatively in good agreement with the experiment, with 3-D simulations currently under investigation to benchmark the effect of spanwise instabilities. Simulation results with the proposed data-driven technique show improvements upon a baseline case by increasing pressure recovery and reducing the region of flow recirculation within the diffuser."

In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces. MuHAN achieves forward spectral predictions in approximately 10ms, thousands of times faster than finite-difference time-domain simulations, boasting 99.85% and 99.9% accuracy for forward and inverse predictions, respectively. By transferring the learned physical principles, we perform inverse design of nanoscale structures with ultrahigh Q-factors (up to 2.9910E5) based on chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) at minimal computational cost.

Our method combines algorithms for synthetic vascular generation with a physics-informed training procedure that integrates graph topological information and local flow dynamics. To ensure the physical reliability of the learned surrogates, we incorporate a physics-informed loss functional derived from the governing equations, allowing enforcement of mass conservation and rheological constraints. The resulting GNN architecture demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse network configurations. The GNN formulation is validated on benchmark problems with linear and nonlinear rheology, showing accurate pressure and velocity field reconstruction with substantial computational gains over full-order solvers. The methodology showcases significant generalization capabilities with respect to vascular complexity, as highlighted by tests on data from the mouse cerebral cortex. This work establishes a new class of graph-based surrogate models for microvascular flow, grounded in physical laws and equipped with inductive biases that mirror mass conservation and rheological models, opening new directions for real-time inference in vascular modeling and biomedical applications."

Closed-form equations of diode input impedance and rectifying efficiency are presented and validated using Advanced Design System simulations. The matching network design of the proposed rectifier is based on the closed-form equations. The preliminary rectifying efficiency is predicted by the closed-form equations as well. Measured and simulated results are in good agreement."

    "abstract": "Triaxial vibration sensor are widely used used in various application. Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system. The overall accuracy of the reference vibration measurement is estimated to be approximately 0.23~\\%. Based on these reference measurements, we investigated the accuracy of earthquake observations using a MEMS accelerometer as a demonstration. The system configuration and testing procedures are presented in this paper."

Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions."

    "abstract": "This work is focussed on understanding the fundamental fluid dynamics of tidal wakes generated by offshore wind infrastructure in stratified waters, using direct numerical simulations. The tidal flows past the structures are approximated by a uniform quiescent background flow with a two-layer density profile, interacting with a vertically oriented cylinder. Through these simulations we identify the processes through which turbulence generated in the wake of the structures leads to vertical mixing across the thermocline.We identify two fundamentally different flow regimes, dependent on both the stratification strength and the flow Reynolds number. The 'weakly stratified' wake is characterised by a highly energetic wake and a dominance of horizontal shear. As a result, vertical mixing occurs much further downstream than the region of maximum turbulent kinetic energy production. In contrast, the `strongly stratified' wake regime is characterised by a large-scale recirculation region that develops across the thermocline which generates significant vertical shearing. This subsequently leads to time-independent standing waves which account for up to 10% of the total energy budget, and have characteristics similar to 'mode 2' internal solitary waves. The vertical shear introduced near the edges of the thermocline is highly efficient at local mixing, but vertical fluctuations are quickly suppressed as the wake propagates further downstream. We speculate that the emergence of this flow regime may explain discrepancies in previous field observations, which have been unable to detect a coherent wake far downstream of offshore wind infrastructure. Future work should focus on bridging the scale gaps between idealised simulations and the field."

    "abstract": "Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails. The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss. We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work."

The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning.

On an artificial mouth, the blowing pressure range where the second register remains stable can be determined by gradually varying the blowing pressure while keeping the register hole open. However, when the register hole is opened while the instrument is already producing the first register, the range of blowing pressures that lead to a stable second register is narrower than the full stability zone of the second register. This phenomenon is investigated numerically by performing multiple hole openings at different times for each blowing pressure value. The evolution of the probability of reaching the second register is computed, and its relationship with the structure of the basin of attraction of the second register is analyzed."

The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions."

The joint detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves would provide insight into cosmic processes, such as progenitor dynamics and outflows. The joint detection of multiple cosmic messengers can also elevate the significance of the observation when some or all of the constituent messengers are sub-threshold, not significant enough to declare their detection individually. Leveraging data from the LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube observatories, we conducted an archival investigation of sub-threshold multimessenger events. Complementing previous analyses, we used minimal assumptions to search for common sources of sub-threshold gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino candidates during the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Our search did not identify significant joint sources. We therefore derive constraints on the rate density of joint sources for each compact binary merger population as a function of the energy emitted in neutrinos. Only a fraction of the gravitational-wave sources emit neutrinos, if the neutrino emission has high bolometric energy ($>10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ erg)."

As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers."

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs."

A classical example known since the 1930's is that a time series is fully determined by its values on the negative integers if its spectrum has a gap, or at least a sufficiently deep zero. We extend such results to higher dimensions and continuous settings by establishing a connection with the concept of uniqueness pairs, rooted in the uncertainty principle of harmonic analysis. We present several other manifestations of this principle, unify and strengthen seemingly unrelated results across different models: quasicrystals and stealthy processes are shown to be maximally rigid on cones, and discrete integer-valued processes are necessarily periodic when they have a simply connected spectrum. Finally, we identify a surprising class of continuous fields with seemingly standard behavior, such as linear variance and finite dependency range, that undergo a phase transition: they are perfectly interpolable on B(0, $ρ$) for $ρ$ ___ 2 $π$ but exhibit no rigidity for $ρ$ > 2."

An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system.

Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator."

    "abstract": "Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."

For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice. In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process. To validate our theory, we apply insights from our theoretical framework and achieve significant improvements on benchmark datasets."

    "abstract": "We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues."

    "abstract": "Recent efforts have shown that Kantowski-Sachs spacetime provides a useful framework for analyzing perturbations inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions."

    "abstract": "As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions."

    "abstract": "Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization algorithm that has proven to be capable of globally minimizing nonconvex nonsmooth functions across a diverse range of applications while being amenable to theoretical analysis. The method leverages an interplay between exploration of the energy landscape of the objective function through a system of interacting particles subject to stochasticity and exploitation of the particles' positions through the computation of a global consensus about the location of the minimizer based on the Laplace principle. In this paper, we prove strong mean square convergence of the practical numerical time-discrete CBO algorithm to the global minimizer for a rich class of objective functions. For CBO with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, our convergence result features conditions on the choice of the hyperparameters as well as explicit rates of convergence in the time discretization step size $Δt$ and the number of particles $N$. By interpreting the time-discrete algorithm at the continuous-time level through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), our proof strategy combines traditional finite-time convergence theory for numerical methods applied to SDEs with careful considerations due to the fact that the CBO coefficients do not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. To accomodate the latter, we adopt a recently proposed generalization of Sznitman's classical argument, which allows to discard an event of small probability, controllable through fine moment estimates for the particle systems."

    "abstract": "The astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescence signals is expected to be a dominant part of total gravitational wave (GW) energy density in the frequency band of the third-generation detectors. The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction."

A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments."

Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

Our central conclusion is the alignment of the objectives to concrete design elements as countermeasures, whereas certain objectives and countermeasures have no or minimal interferences with each other.

If the algorithm constructing such a (static) equivalent instance whose size is polynomial bounded runs in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time, we say that there exists a (static) equivalent instance for this problem. In this paper we present (static) equivalent instances for Scheduling and Knapsack problems. We improve the bound for the $\\ell_1$-norm of an equivalent vector given by Eisenbrand, Hunkenschröder, Klein, Koutecký, Levin, and Onn and show how this yields equivalent instances for integer linear programs (ILPs) and related problems. We obtain an $O(MN^2\\log(NU))$ static equivalent instance for feasibility ILPs where $M$ is the number of constraints, $N$ is the number of variables and $U$ is an upper bound for the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm of the smallest feasible solution. With this, we get an $O(n^2\\log(n))$ static equivalent instance for Knapsack where $n$ is the number of items. Moreover, we give an $O(M^2N\\log(NMΔ))$ kernel for feasibility ILPs where $Δ$ is an upper bound for the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm of the given constraint matrix.

Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels. This DPRC network is highly scalable on a silicon photonic platform, with flexible extension to hundreds of deep reservoir layers and parallel channels, paving the way toward intelligent optoelectronic systems for advanced real time processing and parallel decision making."

Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\\gtrsim0.6\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs."

Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics.

However, much of this theoretical speedup depends on the quantum circuit design solving the problem. We argue that QC literature has yet to explore more domain specific ansatz-topologies, instead of relying on generic, one-size-fits-all architectures. In this work, we show that incorporating task-specific inductive biases -- specifically geometric priors -- into quantum circuit design can enhance the performance of hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QuGANs) on the task of generating geometrically constrained K4 graphs. We evaluate a portfolio of entanglement topologies and loss-function designs to assess their impact on both statistical fidelity and compliance with geometric constraints, including the Triangle and Ptolemaic inequalities. Our results show that aligning circuit topology with the underlying problem structure yields substantial benefits: the Triangle-topology QuGAN achieves the highest geometric validity among quantum models and matches the performance of classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Additionally, we showcase how specific architectural choices, such as entangling gate types, variance regularization and output-scaling govern the trade-off between geometric consistency and distributional accuracy, thus emphasizing the value of structured, task-aware quantum ansatz-topologies."

    "abstract": "We present FAST-MEPSA, an optimised version of the MEPSA algorithm developed to detect peaks in uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available."

    "abstract": "Atmospheric thermal tides arise from the diurnal contrast in stellar irradiation. They exert a significant influence on the long-term rotational evolution of rocky planets because they can accelerate the planetary spin, thereby counteracting the decelerating effect of classical gravitational tides. Consequently, equilibrium tide-locked states may emerge, as exemplified by Venus and hypothesised for Precambrian Earth. Quantifying the atmospheric thermal torque and elucidating its dependence on tidal frequency -- both in the low- and high-frequency regimes -- is therefore essential. In particular, we focus here on the resonance that affected early Earth, which is associated with a forced Lamb wave. Within the framework of linear theory, we develop a new analytical model of the atmospheric response to both gravitational an thermal tidal forcings for two representative vertical temperature profiles that bracket the atmospheres of rocky planets: (i) an isothermal profile (uniform temperature) and (ii) an isentropic profile (uniform potential temperature). Dissipative processes are incorporated via Newtonian cooling. We demonstrate that the isothermal and isentropic cases are governed by the same general closed-form solution, and we derive explicit expressions for the three-dimensional tidal fields (pressure, temperature, density and wind velocities) throughout the spherical atmospheric shell. These results constitute the foundation for two forthcoming papers, in which analytical formulae for the thermotidal torque will be presented and compared with numerical solutions obtained from General Circulation Models (GCMs)."

Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput. To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings. Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving."

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise."

The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions.

The approach preserves interpretability through a parametric linear component for covariates of primary interest, while a nonparametric DNN component captures complex time-covariate interactions among nuisance variables. We refer to the method as FLEXI-Haz, a flexible hazard model with a partially linear structure. In contrast to existing DNN approaches for partially linear Cox models, FLEXI-Haz does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. We establish theoretical guarantees: the neural network component attains minimax-optimal convergence rates based on composite Holder classes, and the linear estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that FLEXI-Haz provides accurate estimation of the linear effect, offering a principled and interpretable alternative to modern methods based on proportional hazards.

We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \\rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$.

    "abstract": "The mechanical response of elastic porous media confined within rigid geometries is central to a wide range of industrial, geological, and biomedical systems. However, current models for these problems typically overlook the role of wall friction, and particularly its interaction with confinement. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the interplay between the mechanics of the medium and Coulomb friction at the confining walls for slow, quasistatic deformations in response to two canonical uniaxial forcings: piston-driven loading and fluid-driven loading, followed by unloading. We find that, during compression, the stress field evolves according to a quasistatic advection-diffusion equation, extending classical poroelasticity results. The magnitude of friction is controlled by a single dimensionless number proportional to the friction coefficient and the aspect ratio of the confining geometry. During decompression, a portion of the solid matrix remains stuck due to friction, leading to hysteresis and to the propagation of a slip front. In piston-driven loading, the frictional stress is directly coupled to the solid effective stress, leading to exponential damping of the loading and striking changes to the displacement field. However, this coupling limits the energy dissipated by friction. In fluid-driven loading, the pressure gradient locally adds energy, decoupling the frictional stress from the effective stress. The displacement remains qualitatively unchanged but is quantitatively reduced due to large energy dissipation. In both cases, friction can have a substantial impact on the apparent mechanical properties of the medium."

In the first part of the paper, we discuss the standard evolution of binaries that have a non-degenerate donor star and a compact companion. We show that the model fails when to account for the occurrence of binary pulsars when they predict a long-standing mass transfer episode. Models including irradiation feedback and evaporation in close binaries are examined next. Following these sections, we discuss the case of systems with a black hole (BH). We show that if BHs are born non-rotating, binary interaction seems insufficient to speed them up, an indication that BH rotation is a feature present at birth. Finally, we discuss Blue Straggler Stars detected in open and globular clusters. Since they cannot be understood as single-born stars, we evaluate one of the proposed channels is mass transfer in close binaries, and discuss its viability and the limitations of the present models."

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research."

In this paper, we present an analysis of the $\\approx$300-day TESS observation of a blazar 3C 371 using power spectrum density, structure-function, and weighted wavelet Z-transform approaches. To reduce the effect of gaps and noise, Continuous auto-regressive moving averages, Bartlett periodogram, and wavelet decomposition methods are used. We have also used recurrence analysis to account for the nonlinearity present in the data and to quantify variability or periodicity as the recurrent state. Considering the entirety of the TESS observations, we derive the variability timescale to be around 4.5 days. Sector-wise analysis found variability timescales in the range of 3.0--7.0 days, values that are found to be consistent using different methods. When analyzing multiple sectors together, significant variability, which could be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), of duration 3--6 days in individual segments, is detected. These may be attributed to the kink instabilities developed in the jet or the existence of mini-jets inside a jet undergoing precession. We find that these methods, when applied appropriately, can be used to study the variability in TESS data. The noise present in these TESS observations can be minimized using Bartlett's periodogram and wavelet decomposition to recover the real stochastic variability."

More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals."

We analyze the closed system made of a single Dirac particle and an external electromagnetic field. The Poincaré invariance of the dynamics implies that the energy, linear momentum and angular momentum of the whole system must be conserved. The Dirac particle has two distinguished points, the center of charge ${\\bf r}$ and the center of mass ${\\bf q}$. When interacting, the energy expended by the field is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of charge trajectory. The variation of the mechanical energy of the particle is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of mass trajectory. If these two works are different the excess of energy must be transformed into radiation returning that energy to the field. The accelerated Dirac particle radiates. We analyze the spin dynamics of the Dirac particle under an external electromagnetic field. The requirement that the absolute value of the spin for the center of mass observer cannot be modified by the interaction implies a modification of the dynamical equation which includes a new braking term along the center of mass velocity, that can be interpreted as the radiation reaction force."

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems. We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development."

    "abstract": "Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency."

These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul.

Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets."

    "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation\". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM\", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel pilot scheme for multi-user uplink channel estimation in extra-large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAA). The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance."

Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $κ$-scalar field, we compute the $κ$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $κ$-deformed space-time. Our analysis yields an upper bound on the deformation parameter as $a\\leq10^{-18}m$. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-commutative effects become experimentally observable in Casimir effect studies when the ratio of the non-commutative scale to plate separation satisfies $a/L\\leq 10^{-12}$. We also obtain the expression for Stefan-Boltzmann's law in $κ$-Minkowski space-time."

    "abstract": "The utilization of Kerr nonlinearity in lithium niobate has been extensively investigated over the years. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion. Therefore, the demonstrated efficient and broadband Pockels effect induced effective Kerr nonlinearity paves the way for novel applications in diverse fields, including spectroscopy, parametric amplification, quantum correlation studies, and wavelength conversion technologies."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing offers a promising paradigm for electromagnetic eigenmode analysis, enabling compact representations of complex field interactions and potential exponential speedup over classical numerical solvers. Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions."

Building on our first part of the series on the classification of 33 dynamical equivalence classes (regardless of the uniqueness of positive fixed points), we demonstrate in this paper that classes 26 and 27 may indeed exhibit multiple positive fixed points. This reveals a fundamental distinction from both its 2-dimensional analogue and the classical 3-dimensional competitive Lotka-Volterra model. More concretely, by focusing on the model with identical growth and death rates, we establish an equivalent characterization for the (non)uniqueness of positive fixed points. Based on this characterization, we further show that classes 19-25 and 28-33 admit a unique positive fixed point and exhibit trivial dynamics: all trajectories converge to some fixed point (corresponding to harmonic solutions). In contrast, classes 26 and 27 possess richer dynamical scenarios: there can contain a continuum of invariant closed curves, on which orbits may be periodic (corresponding to subharmonic solutions), dense (corresponding to quasi-periodic solutions), or may even consist entirely of positive fixed points (which exhibits the nonuniqueness of positive fixed points)."

    "abstract": "Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation."

One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design."

    "abstract": "Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing data heterogeneity and ensuring privacy in large distributed IoT environments. By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\\%."

The second is graph-theoretic: given a $q$-edge-coloring of a tournament, how long of a directed path can we guarantee whose edges avoid one of the colors? These problems arise naturally in many areas, such as convex geometry and extremal hypergraph theory, and have been extensively studied over the past 50 years. We prove that if $\\varepsilon>0$ is fixed and $q$ is sufficiently large, then every $N$-vertex tournament contains a color-avoiding directed path of length $N^{1-\\varepsilon}$. Consequently, the maximum length of a $(q-1)$-increasing sequence of vectors in $[n]^q$ has length at most $n^{1+\\varepsilon}$. Our results answer a question of Gowers and Long, strengthen several of their results, and extend earlier works of Tiskin and Loh."

The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results."

    "abstract": "Modern deep networks operate in a rough, finite-regularity regime where Jacobian-induced operators exhibit heavy-tailed spectra and strong basis drift. In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \\[ \\partial_t g + \\partial_λ(v g) = -λg + S, \\] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling. We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(λ,t)\\sim -c(t)λ^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $τ(t)=t^αL(t)$ for slowly varying $L$. Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\\neq 0$ produces representation drift. Our results provide a unified spectral framework connecting operator geometry, optimization dynamics, and the universal scaling behavior of modern deep networks."

A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

In this work we improve upon the state of the art results of small set expansion in high dimensional expanders. Our improvement is either on the expansion quality or on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed. One line of previous works [KM22, DD24] has obtained weak expansion for small sets, which is sufficient for deducing cosystolic expansion of one dimension below. We improve upon their result by showing strong expansion for small sets. Another line of works [KKL14, EK16, KM21] has shown strong expansion for small sets. However, they obtain it only for very small sets. We get an exponential improvement on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed by these prior works. Interestingly, our result is obtained by bridging between these two lines of works. The works of [KM22, DD24] use global averaging operators in order to obtain expansion for larger sets. However, their method could be utilized only on sets that are cocycle-like. We show how to combine these global averaging operators with ideas from the so-called ``fat machinery'' of [KKL14, EK16, KM21] in order to apply them for general sets."

We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter. Finally, we investigate the memory burden effect and find that it dramatically prolongs the lifetime of five-dimensional rotating primordial black holes, making them compelling candidates for all the dark matter in the universe."

    "abstract": "Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin."

We present \\prot, a decentralized data marketplace that unifies federated learning, blockchain arbitration, and economic incentives into a single framework for privacy-preserving data sharing. \\prot\\ enables data buyers to submit bid-based requests via blockchain smart contracts, which manage auctions, escrow, and dispute resolution. Computationally intensive training is delegated to \\cone\\ (\\uline{Co}mpute \\uline{N}etwork for \\uline{E}xecution), an off-chain distributed execution layer. To safeguard against adversarial behavior, \\prot\\ integrates a modified YODA protocol with exponentially growing execution sets for resilient consensus, and introduces Corrected OSMD to mitigate malicious or low-quality contributions from sellers. All protocols are incentive-compatible, and our game-theoretic analysis establishes honesty as the dominant strategy. We implement \\prot\\ on Ethereum and evaluate it over benchmark datasets -- MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 -- under varying adversarial settings. \\prot\\ achieves up to 99\\% accuracy on MNIST and 90\\% on Fashion-MNIST, with less than 3\\% degradation up to 30\\% Byzantine nodes, and 56\\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 despite its complexity.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave."

We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency.

    "abstract": "Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics. The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge."

It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluctuations. By employing the Keldysh real-time path integral formalism, we compute the instanton trajectory governing the quantum activation process between these attractors and establish a fundamental connection with the Wigner representation. This relation unifies the steady-state phase-space description with dynamical quantum activation processes. We also derive an analytical expression for the decoherence rate of the system.

With the increase of Tm2O3 concentration, the density values increase from 3.574 to 4.153 g.cm-1, while the molar volume values decrease from 21.145 to 19.445 cm3/mol. Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the existence and conversion of BO3 and BO4. The conversion of BO3 to BO4 would lead to greater bridging oxygens BOs, influencing and reinforcing the glass network. The optical features were studied. The optical band gap decreased by increasing Tm2O3 content in the glass formula, while the index of refraction increased. The parameters take the values between 3.16 eV and 2.31 eV. Other optical and physical constants were determined like optical conductivity, electronegativity, metallization, reflection loss, steepness parameters, and transmission coefficient. Judd-Ofelt theory is used to estimate the optical intensities and line strengths of the present glasses. Radiative lifetimes and branching ratios are evaluated of different manifolds belonging to Tm3+ doped present glasses.

We examine nucleation seeded by preexisting domain walls and demonstrate its strong impact on the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions. The bubble solutions take the form of spherical caps, and the contact angle is fixed by the ratio of the domain-wall tension to the bubble-wall tension. A larger domain-wall tension, or equivalently a smaller contact angle, reduces the wall-seeded bubble volume and lowers the critical nucleation action. For theories with $\\mathbb{Z}_{n\\geq 3}$ symmetry, domain-wall junctions naturally appear and we find that they seed nucleation even more efficiently than the walls themselves. Using a two-scalar-field model as an illustration, we compute nucleation temperatures for both homogeneous and heterogeneous channels and show that junction-seeded nucleation occurs at a higher temperature and is the dominant mechanism that completes the first-order cosmological phase transition."

An exciting direct probe of such non-factorisable and $U$-spin breaking effects is provided by the $D^0\\to K^0_{\\rm S} K^0_{\\rm S}$ channel. This decay is governed by non-factorisable exchange topologies and essentially vanishes in the $U$-spin limit, although it is experimentally well established with a prominent branching ratio.

Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged."

The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories.

In this paper, we give a rigorous definition of a vortex atmosphere and establish its existence and uniqueness. We further compare the planar atmosphere surrounding a 2D vortex dipole with the axisymmetric atmosphere surrounding a 3D vortex ring. In particular, we emphasize and prove the topological distinctions observed by W. Hicks [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1919]: under natural assumptions, every 2D dipole with its atmosphere forms an oval-shaped region, whereas for 3D rings, both spheroidal and toroidal configurations may occur.

The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension. In the opposite infrared regime, the tensor components display inverse-mass dependence, revealing infrared divergences typical of nearly massless scalar fields in curved space. Finally, we evaluate the trace of the renormalized tensor and show that for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field the trace anomaly vanishes, confirming the absence of a genuine Weyl anomaly in odd-dimensional spacetimes. These results provide a consistent and covariant description of quantum vacuum polarization and backreaction effects in three-dimensional de Sitter geometry."

The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits."

    "abstract": "PANDA is a powerful generic algorithm for answering conjunctive queries (CQs) and disjunctive datalog rules (DDRs) given input degree constraints. In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs. The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power."

This problem is mainly motivated by applications to non-equilibrium energy sinks. While the effect of adding noise to the fast variable, which is important for noise-induced tipping, has been previously analysed in detail, the case where the slow variable is perturbed by noise has not been considered before. Our main result is that the noise increases the slow variable on average. We compute the effect of the noise, to lowest order, on the expectation and variance of the slow variable after the bifurcation. The contribution of the noise can be explicitly expressed in terms of Airy functions. We also provide numerical simulations, which show that the expansion to lowest order matches the observations for fairly large values of the noise intensity."

Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers."

    "abstract": "Dual-function localization and sensing (DFLS) technology based on commercial communication and localization (CCL) UWB chips has attracted substantial attention, as it shares spectrum and hardware resources, enabling ubiquitous sensing without incurring additional hardware cost. In DFLS UWB systems, channel impulse response measurements (CIRMs) play a critical role in sensing tasks. However, non-ideal factors in UWB systems lead to time, phase, and amplitude misalignment among CIRMs, severely degrading sensing performance. Existing methods cannot achieve phase alignment, and rely on timestamps provided by CCL UWB chips for time alignment, which suffer from low accuracy in harsh environments. These shortcomings limit the applicability and functionality of DFLS UWB systems. This article investigates the CIRM misalignment issue in DFLS systems based on CCL UWB chips. Through an in-depth analysis of the DFLS architecture and UWB frame reception, we establish, for the first time, a mathematical model that characterizes the relationship between non-ideal factors in UWB systems and CIRM misalignment. Accordingly, we propose a joint time, phase, and amplitude CIRM alignment (JTPA-CIR) algorithm, Building upon the well-established bistatic synchronization methods, JTPA-CIR is tailored for DFLS UWB systems and extends this framework to multistatic cases. Exploiting the stability of the direct path in UWB propagation, JTPA-CIR estimates and compensates for the time delay, carrier phase, and amplitude discrepancies of the direct path across CIRMs that stem solely from CIRM misalignment. JTPA-CIR eliminates the reliance on chip-provided timestamps, and achieves CIRM alignment in time, phase and amplitude. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of JTPA-CIR and demonstrate its substantial improvement in sensing performance over existing methods."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Robust defect detection is a crucial link in vision-based measurement systems. However, noise and lighting in complex industrial environments can weaken the structural and edge information of defects, leading to unsatisfactory measurement accuracy. Recent studies have employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to enhance defect features using multi-resolution frequency subbands. However, they exhibit a bias toward frequency branches that compromise spatial cues, resulting in inadequate feature enhancement. To address these challenges, this study considers enhancing measurement features from a joint spatial–frequency perspective and proposes a wavelet-guided spatial-frequency prior network (WSP-Net). At the structural level, a dynamic prior excavator and a dual-domain detail aggregator are constructed to adaptively mine and aggregate discriminative spatial-frequency defect priors. At the decision level, a frequency-assisted task-aware head (FT-Head) is customized to further enhance task-specific semantics and edges through decoupling DWT. In addition, joint supervision is introduced to constrain fine regression for complex defects with ambiguous boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various vision-based measurement systems (e.g., PCB: 95.7% mAP; steel plates: 82.1% mAP; pipelines: 98.7% mAP), while maintaining low computational cost (Parameters: 9.1M, FLOPs: 12.8G FPS: 235-284 imgs/s). It also achieves remarkable performance under strong noise and low-light conditions. Furthermore, generalization analysis using real-world pipeline data from MFL-based measurements indicates that the method holds strong potential for engineering applications in real-world measurement systems."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity reconstruction of the Posterior Eyeball Shape (PES) is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of sight-threatening diseases such as high myopia, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. However, existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- and optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based methods either provide only coarse scleral geometry or suffer from suboptimal PES representations due to limited field of view (FOV) and detail loss, hindering accurate assessment of intact retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities. In this study, we propose the Polar Subarea-Aware Fusion Net (PSAFNet), a novel end-to-end framework that reconstructs complete and high-fidelity PES directly from a single local OCT scan, even under clinically common settings with only 6.25% FOV. To avoid information loss, we reformulate PES reconstruction as a 2D dense regression task and introduce the Ocular Shape Map (OSM), an innovative lossless 2D representation that encodes 3D coordinate attributes into corresponding image channels. PSAFNet then leverages three dedicated modules—Subarea Feature Embedding Module (SFEM), Channel- and Patch-wise Fusion Blocks (CFB/PFB), and Reassemble and Up-sample Module (RUM)—to enhance positional awareness, integrate local–global features, and achieve high-resolution OSM prediction. Furthermore, we construct two large-scale datasets, POSDiag and PESGen, comprising 794 ultra-widefield OCT scans from diverse health conditions and imaging devices, providing a comprehensive benchmark for PES reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSAFNet consistently outperforms existing methods (e.g., EMD=5.58, AAL=97.3%) and exhibits strong clinical relevance, validated by superior performance in downstream disease classification and ophthalmologist evaluations (Expert-Score=82.78%). The source code of the proposed PSAFNet is released at https://github.com/HKUZJ77/PSAFNet."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the superiority of graph neural networks (GNNs) in the aspect of relational modeling has been confirmed in rotating machinery fault diagnosis field. However, most GNNs based intelligent diagnostic methods struggle to construct high-precision and low-complexity graph and perform poorly without efficient graph update strategies. To solve these problems, a semisupervised high-order graph diffusion network (SHGDN) for cross domain fault diagnosis is proposed in this study. First, the discriminative subsequences called Shapelets are sufficiently extracted by diffusion model. Thereafter, fast dynamic time warping and sparse strategy are leveraged to construct dynamic graph with semantic perception ability. Second, a high-order graph diffusion network based on approximate personalized propagation of neural predictions is put forward, which can implement dual-stream aggregation modeling for local first-order neighbors and global high-order neighbors. Then, the pseudolabel guided dynamic graph optimization and Leiden algorithm-based subgraph exchange enhancement is developed to reduce the cumulative propagation of pseudolabel errors. Finally, the explicit theoretical connection between graph construction and graph update is established, which can break the limitation of parameter isolation and provide a unified framework for model optimization. The proposed method is demonstrated on datasets from three types, and the experimental results indicate the SHGDN achieves the average accuracy of 97.29<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Political sectarianism is fueled in part by misperceptions of political opponents: People commonly overestimate the support for extreme policies among members of the other party. These misperceptions inflame partisan animosity and may be used to justify extremism among one's own party. Research suggests that correcting partisan misperceptions-by informing people about the actual views of outparty members-may reduce one's own expressed support for political extremism, including partisan violence and antidemocratic actions. However, there remains a limited understanding of how the design of correction interventions drives these effects. The present study investigated how correction effects depend on different representations of outparty views communicated through data visualizations. Building on prior interventions that present the average outparty view, we consider the impact of visualizations that more fully convey the range of views among outparty members. We conducted an experiment with U.S.-based participants from Prolific (N=239 Democrats, N=244 Republicans). Participants made predictions about support for political violence and undemocratic practices among members of their political outparty. They were then presented with data from an earlier survey on the actual views of outparty members. Some participants viewed only the average response (Mean-Only condition), while other groups were shown visual representations of the range of views from 75% of the outparty (Mean+Interval condition) or the full distribution of responses (Mean+Points condition). Compared to a control group that was not informed about outparty views, we observed the strongest correction effects (i.e., lower support for political violence and undemocratic practices) among participants in the Mean-only and Mean+Points condition, while correction effects were weaker in the Mean+Interval condition. In addition, participants who observed the full distribution of out-party views (Mean+Points condition) were most accurate at later recalling the degree of support among the outparty. Our findings suggest that data visualizations can be an important tool for correcting pervasive distortions in beliefs about other groups. However, the way in which variability in outparty views is visualized can significantly shape how people interpret and respond to corrective information."

This dataset is generated through the two-source energy balance model coupled to soil moisture (TSEB-SM) and a novel reconstruction method (DNN-ETo) using deep neural networks and reference evapotranspiration. This dataset showed good agreement with ground measurements across various landcover types with a RMSE, bias, NSE and KGE of 1.02 mm day-1, -0.17 mm day-1, 0.51 and 0.73. Regarding spatial distributions and interannual variations, TSEB-SM ET exhibits similar performance to previous studies, while providing more reasonable values in the arid and semi-arid regions.

    "abstract": "To effectively fuse multisource underwater sensor data and enhance the localization accuracy of underwater robots in complex environments, we propose a multimodal end-to-end sonar–inertial odometry deep learning network tailored for underwater environments, named DeepWavelet. The network jointly utilizes imaging sonar images and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sequence data to estimate the absolute trajectory of the underwater robot. Specifically, DeepWavelet converts interframe sonar images into point clouds to enrich the input representation. A spatial feature extraction module is applied to the sonar images to capture features rich in edges and textures, which are further decomposed into low- and high-frequency components via the Haar wavelet transform and then fused. Meanwhile, point cloud information is processed through feature extraction and grid mapping to obtain a structured spatial representation. In parallel, the IMU data are modeled using a network based on gated recurrent units to extract temporal features incorporating sensor biases. Moreover, to bridge the gap between cross-modal and cross-scale features, a multiscale dual-modal alignment filter is proposed, employing a dual cross-attention mechanism to achieve deep fusion of different modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepWavelet achieves outstanding localization accuracy and generalization ability on both simulation and real-world data sets. Even in challenging scenarios characterized by large interframe intervals and severe data loss, DeepWavelet exhibits greater robustness compared to traditional methods."

A 97-GHz optical local oscillator is then used to up-convert and succesfully transmit broadband wireless data signals with different complex modulation formats, including single-carrier and orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) QPSK and 16-QAM, with net information rate up to 4 Gb/s."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of resilient secondary frequency control in distributed renewable energy microgrids under False Data Injection Attacks. A rigorous Lyapunov based stability analysis is conducted, and a formal theorem is established that quantifies the maximum tolerable attack intensity under both actuator and sensor side intrusions. This theoretical tolerance boundary provides a principled and interpretable threshold for real time attack detection and secure control activation. Building upon this result, we propose a resilience framework that tightly integrates the derived physical safety boundary with an adaptive reinforcement learning controller. Specifically, a Double Replay Q-learning algorithm is developed, leveraging dual Q-tables and prioritized experience replay to enhance convergence speed and robustness under nonlinear REM dynamics. Simulation results conducted on both a real world experimental REM platform and a modified IEEE 9-Node test system validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Homogeneous anisotropic spherical model is employed to represent the human head, assuming uniform conductivity throughout the domain with directional anisotropy in both the radial and tangential directions. The internal anatomical complexity of the head, comprising distinct biological tissues such as brain matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull, and scalp with varying electrical conductivities is not considered in this model. Analytical expressions for the electric potential generated by a dipolar source at varying depths within the head are derived, with particular emphasis on the role of anisotropy in the radial direction. Our findings show that anisotropic conductivity significantly influences the potential distribution, especially for deeper sources, as compared to isotropic models. For instance, at a source depth of 0.01 m, the electric potential in the anisotropic model is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.0161315 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{V}$</tex>, while for a 0.06 m depth, the potential increases to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.17645 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{V}$</tex>. These results demonstrate that deeper sources experience a greater effect from anisotropic tissues, which underscores the importance of incorporating tissue-specific anisotropy into EEG modeling. Additionally, our study corroborates prior researches, highlighting the critical need to account for the anisotropy of cranial tissues, particularly the skull and white matter, to avoid significant source localization errors. By integrating anisotropic conductivity tensor, this work improves the forward problem solution and contributes to more accurate inverse source localization, with implications for both clinical and research applications in non-invasive brain mapping."

    "abstract": "Understanding how the structure of functional connectivity in the visual cortex changes over time and across brain states is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms by which neurons coordinate to process information and support behavior. Higherorder visual areas in mice are known to exhibit more distinct, segregated functional roles compared to the primary visual cortex (V1) [1], and they maintain stimulus representations over extended time scales [2]. However, the stability of the architecture of their functional connectivity across time and brain states remains less understood. In vivo mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging was used to simultaneously record activity from thousands of neurons across V1 and the extra-striate anterolateral area (AL) in mice, during both visual stimulation (optical-flow/motion) and at resting state (i.e., absence of stimulus). We then applied the spike time-tiling (STTC) coefficient [3] to estimate the pairwise correlations of the neuronal firing and form the functional connectivity at the cell resolution. We then comparatively analyzed the functional connections within area AL and V1 under both stimulus-driven and resting-state conditions. The functional connectivity within AL remains consistently more robust over time than in area V1. Moreover, the structure of the functional connectivity in AL exhibits a smaller change between these two conditions compared to V1, indicating that functional connectivity derived from spontaneous activity more faithfully reflects the functional network architecture elicited by visual stimulation in this higherorder area. Finally, during the resting state, AL activity and functional connectivity are less dependent on pupil size than those of V1, indicating that arousal exerts a weaker modulatory effect on AL compared to V1."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, the volatility and seasonality of wind–solar–hydropower systems have become increasingly prominent. Hydrogen energy storage, with its capability for multi-time-scale regulation, has become a key approach to enhancing system stability and flexibility. This paper develops an optimization model for a multi-energy system integrating photovoltaics, wind power, hydropower, electrolyzers, fuel cells, and both short-term and seasonal hydrogen storage. The model incorporates three operating modes of electrolyzers to reflect differences in efficiency. Using real-world data from southwestern China, the study systematically compares three hydrogen storage strategies—short-term storage, seasonal storage, and dual-cycle coordinated storage—based on key indicators such as operating cost, energy consumption, and electricity purchases. Results show that the dual-cycle strategy reduces electricity purchases by 33.4%, limits start-up/shutdown energy consumption to within 1260 kWh, and lowers total operating costs to below 182 million CNY, significantly outperforming the single-mode strategies. Further analysis demonstrates that this strategy combines the rapid responsiveness of short-term storage with the large-scale balancing capability of seasonal storage, achieving a favorable balance between economic performance and operational reliability. It is well suited for optimizing hydrogen storage dispatch in high-renewable-penetration scenarios."

    "abstract": "RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) has emerged as the de facto standard for IoT routing, offering robust, energy-efficient, and scalable communication. However, its susceptibility to unique cyber-security attacks demands robust security enhancements to ensure reliable deployment. Although Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer a proactive defense mechanism to mitigate RPL's inherent vulnerabilities, traditional IDS solutions are often too resource-intensive for IoT environments. Therefore, there is a critical need for lightweight-yet-accurate IDS frameworks specifically designed for RPL-based networks. In this paper, we propose a novel two-tier intrusion detection system, DTranIDS, designed to effectively identify and classify RPL-specific attacks in IoT environments. In the first tier, a Decision Tree classifier rapidly filters incoming data to determine whether a given instance is benign or malicious. In the second tier, a Transformer-based model is employed to precisely classify the specific type of detected attack. Unlike prior hybrid shallow-deep approaches that rely on heavy and computationally intensive models, DTranIDS leverages the Transformer for efficient deep feature extraction, making it significantly faster and lighter while maintaining high classification accuracy. This combination of cascading decision filtering and a lightweight deep model constitutes the core innovation of this work, enabling both real-time detection and detailed attack classification in resource-constrained IoT environments. The proposed model is evaluated using the ROUT-4-2023 dataset, which includes four common RPL routing attacks: Blackhole, Flooding, Version Number, and Decreased Rank. Experimental results demonstrate that DTranIDS achieves an overall accuracy of 97%, with precision, recall, and F1-score values all around 96%, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art IoT intrusion detection methods (which typically achieve 88–91% accuracy). Moreover, DTranIDS shows its efficiency in fast intrusion detection (about 0.4 s), indicating that it is well-suited for real-world, resource-constrained IoT environments, offering both real-time intrusion detection and detailed attack classification capabilities to aid cybersecurity analysts."

The proposed methodology establishes a rigorous framework for voltage sag risk assessment in high-renewable-penetration power systems.

Traditional partial discharge (PD) detection methods are constrained by field noise and sunlight interference, struggling to meet unattended inspection needs. Ultraviolet (UV) imaging-based PD detection, with its sensitivity to the \"sun-blind\" band (220–280 nm), exhibits superior performance in complex outdoor scenarios, as this specific wavelength range effectively avoids ambient light interference and enhances signal-to-noise ratio.This paper presents an intelligent detection system integrating UV imaging acquisition and a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for PD recognition, deployed on a quadruped robot platform to enable stable operation and real-time data processing in field environments. The quadruped robot’s adaptive movement capability allows it to traverse uneven terrains common in converter stations, while the lightweight CNN model ensures efficient computation without compromising detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel approach for estimating story points in agile software projects by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) models combined with interpretability techniques. Task descriptions are first transformed into semantic embedding vectors, and then classified into four categories—Small, Medium, Large, and Huge—using a BERT-based classifier. To enhance model interpretability, the CLS embedding vectors are extracted, dimensionally reduced, and clustered via K-Means to clearly reveal class boundaries and overlaps. Experimental results demonstrate a high overall accuracy of 88.71% and an average F1-score exceeding 0.87, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Analysis of confusion matrices and semantic clustering indicates challenges in distinguishing between the small and medium classes, which could be alleviated by incorporating richer contextual features. The proposed framework, by providing interpretable insights alongside robust accuracy, represents an important step towards increasing transparency and trustworthiness in intelligent story point estimation systems for agile projects. Finally, recommendations for future work include employing more advanced language models, optimizing model performance, and expanding training datasets for improved generalizability."

    "abstract": "Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance, providing “assistance as needed”. We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions, including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and adherence."

Among them Anterior Crucial Ligament (ACL) tears occur mostly in athletes (50%-70%), aged people (5%-10%) and people with previous injuries (20%-30%). ACL tears are complicated to identify, and segmentation is also a tedious process because of their complex morphological structures. Along with manual interpretation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diagnosis is essential in confirming the ACL tears. An automated decision support system aids medical professionals in detecting and confirming the ACL tears. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are efficient in feature selection as it recognizes textures with local connectivity and spatial hierarchy. Hyperparameter values vary depending on the dataset and neural network architectures. As manual tuning is performed unsystematically, it is time-consuming to identify the correct parameters. So, the proposed work trained CNN-based deep learning models to classify knee MRI into normal, partial torn and full torn ACL. Also, the hyperparameters are optimized efficiently by Bayesian optimization techniques. With the implementation of transfer learning, SqueezeNet, DarkNet-53 and DenseNet-201 are compared with the performance of optimized hyperparameters. After Bayesian Optimization, these models performed well with greater accuracy and less computational time. In conclusion, optimized SqueezeNet, DarkNet-53 and DenseNet-201 architectures provide an efficient decision support system to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis of ACL tears."

Many modern methods of detecting a car's license plate are only good under very specific conditions or strong assumptions, such as when the captured image is clear and taken under good lighting conditions. However, they perform poorly if the assessed car license plate images have a degree of rotation due to the manual capture by traffic police or deviation of the camera. In order to detect car license plates in both directions, we propose a CNN based MD-YOLO framework. MD-YOLO is an extended version of YOLO framework which will be helpful for detecting the number plates from the images which are taken from the side view. Our method, which makes use of precise rotation angle prediction and a fast intersection-over-union evaluation strategy, effectively manages rotational issues in real-time scenarios. Several experiments have been conducted to show that the proposed method outperforms other current state-of-the-art methods in terms of better accuracy and lower computational cost."

This pipeline enhances the fine-grained surgical action prediction capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in surgical environments. It does this by integrating visual temporal analysis with domain-specific surgical knowledge constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of hierarchical knowledge tips for specific phases, achieving optimal exact accuracy of 37.44% with 8 images and peak approximate accuracy of 57.85% with 5 images. The rise-then-fall pattern in performance indicates that increasing the number of images does not necessarily improve results, suggesting limitations in current models’ ability to effectively utilize sequential visual information. This work lays a foundation for further fine-grained surgical planning and decision-making."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel targetless method for estimating the extrinsic parameters of multiple fisheye cameras mounted outside of a vehicle. Without using any artificial calibration target, we use image features in the detected road vehicles and depth data of the surrounding scenes. To solve the severe image distortion problem, fisheye images are first transformed into cylindrical image space. This enables the direct use of existing object detection and monocular depth estimation networks. After the image transformation, feature points in the detected vehicles are extracted and matched across multiple camera views. At the same time, the estimated depth from the monodepth network is used to convert the cylindrical images into 3D point clouds. To solve the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth, the depth information of the surrounding scene is rescaled using the assumption that the xz-plane of the front camera is parallel to the ground. Then, the point clouds were aligned to estimate the camera poses, and the scale was corrected accordingly. Video sequences from the fisheye cameras are used to collect sufficient image features and depth for this process. We validate our method through both real-world and simulation-based experiments. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms COLMAP and DUSt3R even under conditions of wide baseline and low frame rate. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective in practical scenarios and can be applied without the use of calibration targets."

    "abstract": "The automation of customer support operations depends on proper ticket classification systems to achieve better operational efficiency and faster response times. The research evaluates eight algorithms including Naive Bayes and Decision Tree and Random Forest and Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine and XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network for ticket classification tasks. The research utilized two datasets which included public Kaggle information and confidential enterprise data through twelve testing scenarios that analyzed both category and priority classification with three different text sources (title, description and full text). Most algorithms demonstrated exceptional performance in priority classification because this task proved simpler than category classification according to the results (Accuracy/F1 > 0.95). The enterprise dataset results showed that category classification proved more difficult than priority classification because enterprise-specific terminology decreased overall accuracy. The combination of title and description text in input data led to better model performance in all experimental runs. The performance of deep learning models was matched or exceeded by classical machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression and SVM and XGBoost. The CNN achieved optimal results when processing complete ticket texts but RNN demonstrated poor performance especially when working with brief ticket titles. The research indicates that traditional machine learning algorithms should be considered for ticket classification systems because they deliver both strong performance and efficient computation. The research team plans to study transformerbased models together with multilingual datasets to boost real-world application robustness."

Graphene oxide (GO) is used as a starting material. NaOH concentration varied at 0.1 M, 0.5 M, and 1.0 M. The study’s comprehensive characterization, including UHR-SEM, EDX, TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman, UV-Vis, PL, and zeta potential, revealed that 0.5 M NaOH yielded optimal GQDs with well-dispersed particles (~ 3.3 nm) and higher colloidal stability (-42.6 mV). In contrast, 0.1 M concentration resulted in a smaller average size (~1.3 nm) but formed aggregated particles while 1.0 M concentration led to excessive oxidation and structural degradation of the carbon material. These findings highlight the crucial role of NaOH concentration in tuning the structural and optical characteristics of GQDs and offer insights into optimizing their performance for practical implementation in future nanomaterial applications"

    "abstract": "The structural integrity of oil and gas well casings is directly related to production safety and environmental risk prevention and control. However, under the coupled effects of high temperature, high pressure, chemical corrosion, and complex in-situ stress, it is highly prone to induce hidden damages such as pipe wall thickness reduction and microcrack propagation. Traditional damage detection methods based on fixed thresholds have significant limitations under complex downhole noise interference, often leading to an uncontrollable increase in the false alarm rate, which severely restricts detection reliability. To address this issue, this study proposes a variational mode decomposition-constant false alarm rate (VMD-CFAR) joint detection framework: First, the original logging signals are subjected to adaptive frequency band decomposition via VMD to suppress background noise interference; then, the optimally selected intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are input into multi-type CFAR detectors to achieve threshold decision-making with dynamic background perception. Through systematic simulation experiments, the combined performance of different IMF components and CFAR algorithms is quantitatively analyzed, and the optimal VMD-CFAR parameterization scheme is finally determined."

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are vital for marine biodiversity but are increasingly endangered by climate change, pollution, and human activities. Therefore, monitoring these habitats is critical for conservation, yet conventional survey methods are time-consuming and lack stability. This study addresses these difficulties by evaluating the performance of recent YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models-YOLOv8 through YOLOv12-for automatic coral species detection in underwater imagery. The project utilizes 646 annotated underwater images containing six coral species from the SCoralDet dataset, originally developed by the Coral Germplasm Conservation and Breeding Center at Hainan Tropical Ocean University, China. The dataset was pre-annotated and preprocessed using Roboflow and used for training and evaluation with the Ultralytics YOLO framework in Python. Models were evaluated based on key performance metrics: mean Average Precision (mAP@50), precision, recall, and inference speed. Among the models, results show that YOLOv9 achieved the highest detection accuracy (mAP@50 = 81.6%), while YOLOvl1 produced nearly comparable results (mAP@50 = 80.9%) with more consistent performance across evaluation metrics and faster inference. These findings illustrate the potential of recent YOLO models for precise, real-time detection of coral species and provide a comparative study that can inform future uses of deep learning in the monitoring of marine biodiversity."

Traditional Single Phase Shift (SPS) control suffers from high current stress and limited soft-switching range under voltage mismatch conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual-objective optimization strategy for current stress and soft-switching compatibility based on Triple Phase Shift (TPS) control. By analyzing the operational modes and soft-switching constraints under TPS, normalized power and current stress models are established. The optimal phase-shift angle combinations are solved using the Lagrange Multiplier Method (LMM) combined with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, enabling minimum current stress and soft-switching compatibility across the full power range. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, under a voltage ratio of k=2 and a power range of 0∼625W, the proposed strategy achieves a 32% reduction in current stress and improves overall efficiency by 5%–8%. This study provides theoretical support for multi-objective optimization control of DAB converters, with future research focusing on integrating dead-time effects and transient magnetic bias suppression strategies."

    "abstract": "Long-term annual peak load forecasting is one of the critical issues in power system planning and development. Accurate prediction of peak load plays a vital role in capacity planning, energy resource management, and preventing potential crises in the electricity grid. Without precise peak load forecasting, planning for developing power plants, transmission lines, and related infrastructure will face significant challenges. Every country needs a clear understanding of its future energy consumption patterns to achieve its development goals and meet growing energy demands. This issue is particularly important in developing countries like Iran, which face increasing challenges in energy supply and demand. In this paper, the main objective is to forecast the long-term annual peak load in Iran. To achieve this goal, artificial intelligence methods such as LSTM, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees are utilized. Additionally, three curve-fitting models, including the Modified Exponential Curve, Logistic Curve, and Gompertz Curve, are employed for peak load forecasting. These methods are combined with time series modeling to enhance prediction accuracy. MATLAB software is used for implementing and testing all the proposed models, ensuring robust and reliable forecasting results. Finally, the performance of all these methods is compared, and the most suitable model for forecasting Iran's peak load is selected. This research not only provides an accurate method for peak load forecasting but also analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The results demonstrate that combining artificial intelligence methods with time series modeling can serve as a powerful tool for long-term energy planning. This study can act as a practical guide for experts and policymakers in the field of power system management and development."

Traditional robotic manipulators for aerospace drilling operations are huge, expensive, and lack safety, while cobots, which are more affordable and safer, cannot produce the required clamping force for the drilling process. However, we designed ExoBrake as an add-on kit for a cobot —currently under patent application— which can produce and withstand the required clamping force for drilling stacked metallic sheets in aerospace manufacturing. Moreover, an interactive Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with a graphical user interface is developed for ExoBrake, including online digital twins of ExoBrake, the workpiece, and the test bed. This CPS replicates digitally the assembly of the cobot-ExoBrake and enables the operator to configure the workpiece, define and execute drilling tasks. The main novelty of this CPS is the interactive drilling task definition from the workpiece geometry itself, rendered in the visualization panel. It also controls the entire system and drilling sequence. Experiments are conducted to ensure the CPS functions to apply a specific clamping force and control it during the drilling process."

This paper presents a novel hybrid approach combining YOLOv8 object detection with Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multi-cluster grape segmentation, alongside comprehensive evaluation of CNN encoder-decoder architectures for single-cluster scenarios. Using the GrapesNet dataset containing over 11,000 diverse vineyard images, we trained and evaluated various segmentation models including U-Net variants with pre-trained encoders, SegNet architectures, and fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The MobileNetV2-UNet achieved superior single-cluster segmentation with mIoU of 0.906 and Dice coefficient of 0.984, demonstrating computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. For multi-cluster scenarios involving overlapping grape clusters, our hybrid YOLOv8-SAM approach demonstrated exceptional performance with mIoU of 0.943 and Dice coefficient of 0.970, significantly outperforming traditional CNN-based methods by 4.1% in IoU scores. The hybrid methodology addresses key challenges in agricultural computer vision including variable lighting conditions, cluster occlusion, and complex vineyard backgrounds. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component, while computational analysis demonstrates practical deployment feasibility. The primary contribution lies in demonstrating that foundation models like SAM, when combined with robust object detection, can effectively handle complex agricultural scenes with overlapping grape clusters, advancing automated harvesting and real-time yield estimation technologies for precision viticulture applications."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of smart grid technologies and the growing penetration of renewable energy sources, traditional flat-rate electricity pricing models have become inadequate for addressing demand-side management challenges and improving energy efficiency. Time-of-use (TOU) pricing has emerged as a promising dynamic pricing mechanism to incentivize load shifting, mitigate peak demand, and enhance power system stability by aligning electricity prices with temporal variations in supply and demand. This study proposes an enhanced TOU pricing framework that overcomes the limitations of conventional models by explicitly accounting for seasonal load variations and differentiated consumption patterns across residential, commercial, and industrial users. A seasonal clustering-based method is adopted for time period segmentation, enabling user-specific period definitions. To solve the resulting multi-constraint nonlinear optimization problem, an Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) is employed, which effectively explores the solution space through guided, territorial, and migratory foraging behaviors. Empirical analysis using real-world load data from a province in China validates the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in peak shaving, valley filling, and pricing fairness. The results underscore the framework's potential to support sustainable energy system development and offer practical insights for utilities and energy policy formulation."

Asymmetrical multilevel inverters enhance output voltage by producing near-sinusoidal waveforms with reduced harmonic distortion. In transformerless SPV systems, varying common-mode voltage can induce leakage currents through parasitic capacitance between the PV array and ground, leading to safety concerns and reduced system performance. The proposed 7L-T-AMLI grid-tied SPV system addresses these challenges by effectively balancing the inverter’s capacitor voltages, thereby suppressing leakage current and maintaining high power quality. Simulation results in MATLAB confirm the effectiveness of the design, achieving a negligible leakage current and a grid current with a low total harmonic distortion (THD) of 2.21%."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks dominate the landscape of artificial intelligence models and are used in many applications, but their high computational complexity makes executing them in real time very costly in terms of power. Hence, custom energyefficient accelerators have become a need in some domains. Lowprecision integer arithmetic and approximate compute circuits are two popular optimizations often contemplated for saving hardware resources and power consumption. These techniques are usually considered as separate and independent approximations, but in reality they are inextricably linked. In this work, we explore the interaction and trade-off between quantization and approximate circuits in the context of deep neural network acceleration by evaluating several circuits, including approximate multipliers, approximate adders, and combinations thereof, while using different integer precisions. Additionally, we study how approximate multiplier and adder circuits can be combined to further push energy efficiency. We use the YOLOv3 object detection network to assess the accuracy impact of the circuits in a state-of-the-art complex deep learning model. By combining approximate arithmetic circuits with low-precision quantization, we generate approximate MAD circuits with over 60% less power consumption and near identical accuracy compared to using only quantization. Nevertheless, we find that quantization plays a dominant role in the resulting energy efficiency, since the best design points are always found at the lowest bit precisions."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Continual Learning (CL)-based adaptive Approximate Computing (AxC) framework for Micro-electrode array (MEA) spike detection on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), enabling adaptive precision control under key constraints in real-time. Our approach aims to continuously learn from incoming MEA data and configure computational precision in response to dynamic input characteristics and design constraints, i.e., latency and accuracy, which are more critical than power consumption in this case. Towards this, we investigate the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs of MEA spike detection, through precision scaling. Our evaluations at the algorithmic-level reveal that 32-bit floating-point (FP32) single-precision filtering operation performs 1.8× faster than 64-bit floating point (FP64) double-precision baseline, with minimal detection accuracy loss. Moreover, the hardware-synthesized fixed-point implementations demonstrated substantial resource savings and an 86.6% reduction in dynamic power when using 16-bit fixed-point (Fix16) compared to the 32-bit fixed-point (Fix32)."

The work addresses the critical need for polarization diversity in multi-band wireless systems. The proposed design achieves opposite-handedness CP operation—left-hand CP (LHCP) at one band and right-hand CP (RHCP) at the other, which helps in enhancing the interference mitigation and signal robustness. The system employs a compact, double-layer phase-change metasurface (DL-PCM) reflector integrated with a dual-band linearly polarized monopole antenna, enabling the independent control of the amplitude and phase of reflected waves at each frequency. The integrated antenna and DL-PCM configuration results in wide axial ratio bandwidths (27.3% and 25.3%) and high radiation efficiencies (90% and 87%), ensuring optimal performance across both bands. This approach offers the ability to achieve circular polarization when interfaced with any linearly polarized (LP) antenna system, which is a generic approach. Also, the opposite polarization at both bands helps in reducing the interference. This system has a potential for next-generation wireless networks requiring versatile broad impedance and axial ratio bandwidth, high efficiency, and CP operation, notably advancing multi-band antenna solutions for 5G and Wi-Fi 7 applications."

However, existing video quality assessment methods primarily target compression-related distortions, failing to capture display-specific degradations including definition loss, color distortions, and motion artifacts that critically affect user subjective experiences during video playback. To address these limitations, we develop a specialized video dataset, namely Video Displaying Quality Assessment Dataset (VDQA), constructed using a DSLR camera with standardized parameter optimization of exposure settings (aperture, ISO sensitivity, and shutter speed). VDQA comprises 250 high-resolution video clips covering diverse content categories, providing a robust foundation for evaluating display devices across multiple quality dimensions. Additionally, we propose a deep learning-based model specifically designed for display quality assessment that employs three complementary pathways to independently evaluate definition, color fidelity, and motion quality. The model integrates Canny edge detection for explicit sharpness measurement, a color attention mechanism to enhance sensitivity to display color reproduction characteristics, and temporal modeling for motion artifact assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in reflecting user subjective experiences for display content videos compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in both color fidelity assessment and definition evaluation."

However, most current method either require invasive instrumentation or only infer force indirectly from activation, which fails for passive loading conditions. This study presents a compact, implantable force sensor for rat gastrocnemius, utilizing a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor integrated into a custom tendon buckle. The system features a simple structure capable of accurately detecting force transmitted by a single muscle. The design converts tendon tension into measurable bending strain, with Finite Element Analysis optimizing placement and confirming force-strain linearity. A passive muscle–tendon unit (MTU) model was developed to theoretically estimate gastrocnemius force during externally loaded hindlimb motion. Ex vivo calibration and in vivo tests in rat cadavers and live animals demonstrated functionality. Under passive loading, peak tendon forces ranged from 0.5N to 0.63 N, aligning with model predictions (0.48N-0.74 N). Live rats exhibited peak forces near 0.6 N during spontaneous movement. The FBG buckle enables direct tendon force measurement—including passive loading—with optical readout for electromagnetic immunity, miniaturization for small animals, and biocompatibility for chronic implantation, offering advantages over existing strain-gauge, EMG, and imaging-based techniques."

    "abstract": "To prevent battery thermal runaway incidents in electric vehicles (EVs), it is crucial to detect faults on voltage consistency between cells (VCC) in the battery pack by a timely and accurate manner. This paper conducts a naturalistic driving experiment on 20 EVs to collect high-quality vehicle operation data, and proposes an early VCC anomaly detection method that integrates driving behavior features. For four types of micro-running segments of EVs, the model of genetic-algorithm-optimized back propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) is established to estimate the normal voltage variation coefficient between cells (VVCC) during vehicle running. The input features of models include related parameters of ambient temperature, state of charge (SOC), current, vehicle speed, acceleration, and pedal stroke. The GA-BPNN models are validated to exhibit a good robustness. The VVCC anomaly threshold is obtained using methods of Box-Cox transformation, 3σ rule, and box plot. The validation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify early abnormalities before VCC exceeds the conventional threshold. The average recall rate for 12 test EVs is 0.8746. This method overcomes the shortcomings of existing methods that cannot automatically adjust anomaly detection standard due to lacking consideration of driving behavior’s impact on voltage fluctuation."

    "abstract": "The Electric vehicles (EVs) are widely recognized as eco-friendly devices. Consequently, the need for EVs is growing at a rapid pace daily, which has increased the need for charging stations. However, EV battery charging requires sustainable electrical energy sources. The wireless power transfer (WPT) system powered by photovoltaic panels is suggested in this paper as a clean energy source implementation. Although the PV system is exposed to various irradiance patterns, traditional approaches may not be able to capture the global maximum power point (GMPP). Consequently, various types of optimization techniques for adhering to the GMPP have been proposed. However, optimization algorithms lack the capability to differentiate between uniform shading and partial shading patterns. The paper proposes a novel hybrid MPPT method to overcome the limitation and avoid an unnecessary search region of the whole P-V curve through uniform shading conditions (USCs). When the system is exposed to USCs, a new method for determining the optimal power point is proposed. In addition, a modified parrot optimization (MPO) technique will be used to improve the convergence speed by mitigating the partial shading and load variation. The suggested approach was employed experimentally with a sample time of 0.05 s using dSPACE. An experimental prototype was used to test the suggested approach and present results. Consequently, power was transmitted from primary to secondary with 90% efficiency and 99.22% MPPT efficiency with an average convergence speed of 0.51 s. Moreover, the proposed method has been compared with recently published algorithms to illustrate the proposed method’s superiority."

This paper presents a comprehensive narrative review of theories, methods, and technological advancements in assessing cognitive load during driving. Rather than following a systematic review protocol,the structure of the review is organized around key research questions and critical gaps identified in the current literature. We assess the applicability and performance of major evaluation methods, including physiological indicators, behavioral measures, subjective self-report scales, and data-driven approaches, across various driving scenarios. The review also discusses the integration of multi-source information and propose a conceptual framework for holistic and adaptive cognitive load assessment. Furthermore, it highlights challenges in current practices, such as technical constraints, environmental variability, and individual differences. Special emphasis is placed on the relevance of cognitive load assessment for industrial informatics, particularly in the context of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous driving technologies, and driver training programs. This review aims to provide a structured synthesis of current approaches, offer practical insights for application and system design, and guide future research toward developing more robust, generalizable, and context-aware assessment tools. By analyzing the state of the art, we contribute a timely reference to support both academic development and industrial implementation for next-generation intelligent vehicle systems."

    "abstract": "In total-body positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, reducing the radiation dose of diagnostic CT scans is essential for minimizing overall radiation exposure, particularly in pediatric patients. Although deep learning-based denoising methods have shown promise in restoring low-dose CT (LDCT) to normal-dose CT (NDCT) quality, most approaches rely on structurally aligned paired data, which are difficult to acquire in clinical practice. Models trained on synthetic pairs often exhibit limited generalizability to real LDCT data. Unconditional diffusion models demonstrate outstanding generalizability, but fail to preserve structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced diffusion posterior sampling (E-DPS) framework that combines a one-step denoiser U-Net with an unconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the U-Net estimator, trained on simulated LDCT–NDCT pairs, provides preliminary denoised outputs as structural constraints, whereas the diffusion model captures the prior distribution of NDCT images to enhance realism and generalizability. During inference, the U-Net predictions are integrated as constraints with tunable weights, thereby guiding diffusion posterior sampling. In addition, an intermediate-stage initialization strategy is introduced, significantly reducing the number of required sampling steps. Extensive experiments on simulated LDCT datasets across three dose levels demonstrate the superiority of our method, yielding average PSNR gains of +5.2% and +4.3% at unseen dose levels compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, on real LDCT images, E-DPS exhibits strong zero-shot generalizability, achieving better noise suppression while preserving anatomical detail. These results highlight the robustness and clinical potential of E-DPS for LDCT denoising."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of nuclei is a crucial step in advancing pathology image analysis for disease diagnosis and treatment. Recently, prompt learning has shown great promise in universal nuclei classification for multiple datasets, as it can harvest the common knowledge by representing nuclei semantics across different sources. However, remarkable intra- and cross-dataset variability in nuclei categories and their complicated semantic relationships with numerous nuclei are often observed in distinct image instances, leading to two key challenges of instance variability and semantics ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a universal language-guided nuclei classification framework (ULNC) that leverages prompt-based language supervision to overcome these obstacles at the instance level. To address the instance variability issue, we introduce an innovative prompt learning approach that fully exploits unique contextual information of each image instance and generates instance-aware text embeddings highly adaptable to the categorical semantics of varied data sources. Additionally, to tackle the problem of semantics ambiguity, we employ a local vision-language matching loss that explicitly reinforces semantic connections between localized image regions and text prompts for nuclei categories, thus promoting the universal model's ability to learn discriminative image features for generalized nuclei classification. Extensive experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that ULNC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization to unseen domains, highlighting its potential for robust nuclei classification across diverse datasets."

This study presents a comparative evaluation of six distribution transformation techniques, applied during pre-processing to account for subject-specific differences in sEMG signal distributions for upper limb intention prediction. The experimental results indicate that normalization choice significantly affects model performance, with techniques such as Yeo-Johnson leading to the highest accuracy improvement of up to 12.05% in Bi-LSTM prediction models. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate personalized distribution transformation (PDT) strategies to enhance the generalizability and effectiveness of sEMG-based motion intention prediction."

Existing methods struggle to balance estimation performance and energy efficiency under varying reliability and latency requirements. We investigate Multi-Link Operation (MLO) to improve adaptability under dynamic wireless conditions. However, existing schemes offer limited flexibility in transmission modes and rely on simplified network models, which restricts the potential for MLO-specific performance optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel flexible transmission mode selection mechanism called Synchronous-Asynchronous Co-existence Multi-Link Aggregation (SACMLA). Based on switchable MLO modes, we formulate a scheduling-estimation co-design problem that optimizes the trade-off between estimation error covariance and transmission energy consumption. Given the environmental complexity and the action space explosion caused by the joint optimization of transmission mode, packet-to-link mapping, and energy allocation, we design a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Link Co-optimization (HDRL-MLC), a two-tier architecture where a PPO-based outer loop dynamically adjusts scheduling, and an inner loop optimizes energy allocation in MLO. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of the SACMLA mechanism and highlight the superior performance of the PPO-based HDRL-MLC algorithm over flat algorithms in balancing multiple communication metrics and adapting to varying traffic conditions."

    "abstract": "The study of neuroanatomy is an integral part of the education and training of neurosurgeons and aspiring professionals in this field, in which the use of images, videos, models, simulators, and virtual reality can fit into the pedagogy of this medical area. However, individuals who lack a solid understanding of three-dimensionality and proportion encounter challenges when interpreting two-dimensional images. Regardless of all the technology currently available, the stereoscopic images, a technique used by superimposing two images taken from the same region by moving a camera laterally, keeping the same horizontal plane and the same focal length, become valuable by presenting the viewer with the notion of depth and decreasing the learning time. However, when stereoscopic images are generated, many of them do not present the expected results, and could cause discomfort to the observer when analyzed, especially because their depth perception could be altered. In this study, a computational algorithm uses Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, Angle between two vectors, and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) to analyze and compare the two stereo pair images. Thus, six parameters are described that best correlate the two images, classified in order using the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), and used to evaluate the quality of a set of 180 endoscopic endonasal stereo images of the skull base. This study evaluated stereo pairs to determine their suitability for accurate 3D pictures using digital image processing and classification methods. Six parameters tested were effective for class separation, with the most discriminative being the angle between column vectors in the red channel, determined by the highest FDR, and it can serve as a standalone classifier or be used in a multivariate discriminant function for automated quality assessment. This research also determines that existing quality metrics such as Unified No-Reference Quality Assessment via Monocular and the Binocular Local Visual Primitives and Top-Down JND Estimation were ineffective for this specific classification, highlighting the potential of the proposed methodology."

Drawing on foundational work by Socher et al. (2010) for constructing sentence parse trees and Collobert and Weston (2011) for distributed word representations, we implemented a recursive neural network POS tagger. Utilizing Lua and the Torch7 neural network library, we developed two models: a basic RNN and a compositional vector tagger inspired by Socher et al. (2013). Both models leverage distributed word representations to capture contextual information essential for accurate POS tagging. Our basic RNN combines word and phrase representations, while the compositional vector tagger employs tag-dependent weight matrices for phrase representation. Despite challenges with capitalization in our dataset, our models demonstrate the potential of RNNs in capturing linguistic structures for improved POS tagging performance."

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common medical conditions around the world in the modern age. Patients with HF struggle with reduced quality of life and have a greater risk of death. For these reasons it is important for HF to be diagnosed early before it starts to majorly impact patients and cause major concern for death. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is one of the most important features which can be used to further classify HF patients into patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In this paper we describe a machine learning based pipeline for multistage classification of patients according to presence of HF and degree of reduced ejection fraction. Two separate pipelines are created in the scope of our research. Both pipelines classify patients based on whether HF is present or not. The first pipeline classifies HF patients into 3 classes based on their ejection fraction into reduced, mid-range and preserved classes. The second pipeline conducts classification of patients into LVEF <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;50 {\\%}$</tex> and LVEF <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&gt;50 {\\%}$</tex> based on available features, followed by a second classification of HFrEF and HFpEF classes.

The 3-class classification model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 82% with F1 scores of 90%, 51% and 86% for HFpEF, HFmrEF and HFrEF respectively.

Applied to a real-world dataset of 6,039 patients and over 110,000 records across 11 clinical domains, the framework evaluates six dimensions: Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, Compliance, Timeliness, and Fairness. Initial completeness was low <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(48.82 \\%)$</tex>, but improved to 61.04% after cleaning via outlier correction, imputation, and schema normalization. Accuracy and compliance reached 100%, and consistency improved to 99.61%. Fairness, measured via JensenShannon Similarity across age, sex, and BMI, remained at 87.35%, highlighting demographic imbalance remained unresolved by technical cleaning. This is the first standards-aligned, domain-adapted, and fairness-extended DQA pipeline for HF, producing a robust dataset suitable for machine learning and clinical decision support."

To address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and limited universality in existing impedance analysis methods when applied to complex renewable energy clusters, this paper proposes a generalized impedance aggregation method based on network equivalence. First, the impedance network model of renewable energy clusters, considering the characteristics of multiple types of converters, is analyzed, and resonant modes are accurately identified through eigenvalue analysis of the nodal admittance matrix. Subsequently, a generalized impedance aggregation method based on network equivalence is proposed, employing dimensionality reduction techniques for the nodal admittance matrix to transform the high-dimensional network into an equivalent low-dimensional matrix, significantly reducing computational complexity. To validate the effectiveness of the method, a grid-connected system of a renewable energy network is constructed on an electromagnetic transient simulation platform, and simulation analysis is conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Equivalence assessment plays a crucial role in target missile design, as the degree of realism achieved in simulating operational targets directly impacts the credibility of weapon system verification tests. To enhance the simulation accuracy of target characteristics, research on target missile equivalence evaluation has become imperative. Existing methodologies primarily include Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation, Bayesian Networks, and Grey Relational Analysis. These approaches typically determine indicator weights through weighting methods to complete assessments. However, conventional single-weighting techniques often fail to balance expert experience with battlefield data characteristics and rarely incorporate weapon system kill probability for weight adjustment, leading to assessment results that deviate from actual combat requirements. This paper proposes an innovative target missile equivalence evaluation method based on fuzzy membership degrees and hybrid weighting models. By integrating game theory principles, the method balances Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with Entropy Weight Method (EWM), optimizing combination coefficients through the minimization of deviation sums. This ensures weight distribution reflects both expert expertise and battlefield data features of weapon system kill probabilities. To address the differences between qualitative and quantitative indicators, the study combines fuzzy membership functions with G.A. Miller’s Quantification Theory to resolve challenges in precisely quantifying qualitative attributes. By treating weapon system kill probability as the objective attribute in EWM, the approach overcomes traditional limitations of entropy-based methods that rely solely on data distribution, significantly enhancing battlefield adaptability. Through constructing an algorithmic model based on this evaluation framework, the research demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method using two types of target missiles to simulate BrahMos missile threats and obtain equivalence composite values. The results provide theoretical support for target missile design optimization, weapon system test validation, and dynamic battlefield threat assessment, offering significant practical value for military applications."

Our study implements a sub-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in navigating complex scenarios including lane following, straight driving, and left/right turns, and outperforming a single-policy approach for intersection maneuvers. To enhance learning efficiency, our representation learning leverages a deep mobile network for state representation, which significantly reduces image feature complexity. Furthermore, the integration of a single-shot multi-box detector enables the agent to perform realistic tasks such as responding to traffic lights and maintaining safe distances from leading vehicles, without compromising training speed. While the system demonstrates stable driving in various scenarios, current limitations include handling highly complex decisions and adapting to diverse speed limits due to environmental constraints. Future work will focus on expanding training environments and exploring more advanced network architectures to improve real-world applicability and learning efficiency."

Typically, BPLC systems rely on standard, static resource allocation methods with a single tier, which fail to adapt to the changing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and unpredictable channel conditions. Our study introduces a novel, multi-layer resource allocation framework that incorporates a blend of Hybrid Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes—specifically, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), Turbo, and Reed-Solomon coding into a utility-based scheduling model that encompasses the application, medium access control (MAC), and physical layers. The paper's unique focus is on a mid-band frequency span of 2.4 to 5.6 MHz, which is a practical segment of the total BPLC spectrum, capped at 28 MHz. This specific range was chosen to lessen computational complexity and adhere to the commonly simulated PLC channel properties under the Zimmermann model. The experimental outcomes reveal that our proposed technique results in decreased Bit Error Rates (BER), increased overall system performance, and enhanced proportional fairness, outperforming traditional algorithms in scenarios with weak as well as strong channels. By integrating adaptive FEC into the cross-layer model, we ensure superior QoS satisfaction for both real-time and non-real-time data consumers."

    "abstract": "Existing backdoor defense methods for federated learning (FL) usually try to distinguish between benign and malicious clients. The key insight is that benign clients are densely distributed, whereas malicious clients tend to be outliers outside this distribution. However, this only holds when data is independent and identically distributed (IID), and the effectiveness of these methods under non-IID data has not been systematically examined. In this paper, we present a comprehensive systematization of FL backdoor defense by breaking down its overall pipeline into three key components, i.e., metrics for evaluating clients, techniques for amplifying the difference between benign and malicious clients, and mechanisms for identifying malicious clients. We conduct an empirical study of FL backdoor defense methods under non-IID data settings to explore whether benign and malicious clients can be fully distinguished. Experimental results show that the defense performance degrades significantly when data is non-IID. Our results also reveal how evaluation metrics, amplification techniques and identification mechanisms perform under diverse settings. Contrary to the established belief, we further conclude that these defenses have inherent shortcomings, due to lack of stability and robustness in detecting malicious clients. We believe that our findings can better facilitate the development of FL backdoor defenses."

In the second stage, MTM with dimensions of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$30 \\times 30$</tex-math></inline-formula> mm<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> is integrated into the WPT system. The size of MTM does not exceed the area of the resonator, ensuring that the overall volume remains compact. The MTM is arranged in a configuration of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3 \\times 3$</tex-math></inline-formula> unit cells, with the latter being designed using octagonal spirals and exhibiting a permeability of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$-1$</tex-math></inline-formula> at 433 MHz. The MTM is carefully positioned between the coupled resonators in order to effectively mitigate the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {B}$</tex-math></inline-formula> leakage and increase coupling. As a result, the power transfer efficiency (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta$</tex-math></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$d$</tex-math></inline-formula> are both improved, achieving <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta$</tex-math></inline-formula> of 81% at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$d=39$</tex-math></inline-formula> mm. Experimental validation and benchmarking against state-of-the-art systems show a FoM reaching 1. The WPT performance was evaluated in practical application scenarios, considering the effects of misalignment and the presence of nearby objects. Overall, the obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed systematic design approach, marking a significant advancement in WPT technology."

The proposed system was designed as an embedded hardware and software platform capable of high-precision I–V measurements. The system offers significant advantages over existing measurement setups due to its compactness with Li-ion battery power supply, Bluetooth communication capability, and a MATLAB GUI-based user interface. The performance of the system was investigated by comparing it with a widely used sourcemeter. For the testing phase of the system, Ag/ZnO/ITO memristor structure with ZnO layer produced by sputtering method and a top electrode produced by thermal evaporation was used. The active layer of the memristor was characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. I–V measurements were carried out using the developed system on the Ag/ZnO/ITO memristor structure and a rectifier diode. The results demonstrated a high level of compatibility with those obtained from commercial systems. The analyses conducted for measurement precision, stability and accuracy indicate that the proposed system can be a reliable characterization tool for memristors and other two terminal electronic components.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "First wall protection is a critical challenge in fusion machine operation, requiring fast and precise diagnostics. Infrared imaging in long-pulse devices, such as the WEST tokamak, generates vast amounts of thermal video data, making both real-time and postpulse analysis demanding for human operators. Traditional real-time protection has relied on thresholding and conventional image processing, which, while robust, require predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and lack adaptability to new hot spots or camera displacements. Deep learning methods have therefore emerged as promising alternatives, offering greater flexibility and improved detection capabilities. This work presents the comprehensive framework developed over several years for monitoring the WEST’s first wall using infrared imaging. The tools fall into two main categories: active real-time systems integrated with plasma control and decision-support tools for postpulse analysis. In real time, the developed methods include a CPU-optimized model that detects electric arcs on the grill of the heating antennae, which has been successfully deployed with the plasma control system (PCS) to regulate the injected power during the C10 and C11 experimental campaigns (October 2024–April 2025). This model achieved 98% accuracy on C10 data, with only a single false positive occurring after a disruption. Another key component is the GPU-based thermal event detection model, which detects, tracks, and characterizes thermal events in real time, overcoming the limitations of fixed ROIs and enabling the tracking of emerging hot spots. Postpulse decision-support tools are equally important. One example is a detection tool designed to identify and track moving tungsten particles in infrared data, supporting studies of correlations between these particles and plasma disturbances. Additionally, a multimodal large language model (LLM) has been developed to automate pulse summary analysis. This LLM has been actively used by infrared experts between pulses during campaigns. Expert evaluations indicate that over 62% of the model’s outputs were satisfactory. Overall, integrating deep learning into the infrared diagnostic workflow significantly enhances first wall monitoring and protection for fusion devices."

The Asian Paddle Crab (Charybdis japonica), in particular, is an aggressive invader requiring accurate and early identification to support biosecurity. However, such species classification remains challenging due to high visual similarity and the lack of dedicated datasets. To address this gap, we present the New Zealand Pest Crab Classification Dataset (NZPCCD), a fine-grained benchmark designed for ecological crab pest monitoring. The dataset comprises high-quality, annotated images of visually similar crab species, enabling robust training and evaluation of automated classification models. We further developed a classification-adapted YOLO model based on our dataset for crab pest classification and achieve superior classification performance compared with other deep learning models, offering a compelling balance of accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Oyster mushroom (Pleurotus Ostreatus) cultivation is gaining popularity due to its short growth cycle, rich nutrient contents and easy growing. This research proposes a computer vision-based methodology where the YOLOv8 segmentation model has been used to identify oyster mushroom caps from their cultivation bed image data. A manual-annotated polygon-based annotation dataset has been used to train the YOLOv8 segmentation model. This model also provides infestation detection which enables the system to have targeted treatment at an early stage to minimize overall damage and maintain the productivity of the cultivation environment. The problem to be addressed through this study is to determine the optimal harvesting time for oyster mushrooms. This is to prevent overgrown mushroom, contamination and infestation that lead to poor quality of mushroom production. Suitable design of computer vision model is the proposed solution to provide a real-time visual tracking pipeline for oyster mushroom growth monitoring. The trained model achieves mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 91.9% and (mAP@0.5–0.95) of 79.1%. The model’s ability to mask a single mushroom cap size area was established using test images of different classes, from the beginning stage of small-cap size to ready harvest till overgrown large mushroom cap and that resulted in detection. This work explains the setup of the model pipeline which consists of data preparation, model training, and inference. Early post-processing was explored, and the trained model is set out to build a reliable detection framework to be used as a reference point for future maturity analysis, tracking, and harvesting reasoning. The results demonstrate the potential of using deep learning segmentation in mushroom cultivation to enable scalable low-labour monitoring."

Two-dimensional (2-D) perovskites portend a promising materials class owing to moisture resistance, scalable solution processability, and the ability to modulate interface energy-level alignment, positioning them as attractive candidates for multifunctional switching layers (SLs). In this work, europium (Eu)-based 2-D perovskite thin films were systematically tailored through precursor stoichiometry control to correlate microstructural, crystallographic, and surface electronic properties with RS behavior. Progressive transition from porous, defect-rich surfaces to compact, pinhole-free films with enhanced ordering was observed. Ag-electrode-based devices fabricated on the optimized films exhibited forming-free, symmetric bipolar RS with sub-volt thresholds, considerably large memory windows, retention beyond <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10^{{4}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> s, and endurance exceeding <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4\\times 10^{{4}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> cycles.

Neuromorphic evaluation under varied programming pulses revealed a dynamic trade-off; longer pulses expanded dynamic range (DR) but induced higher potentiation nonlinearity, while shorter pulses suppressed filament overgrowth, yielding near-linear weight updates with low nonlinearity index (NLI). Such tunability enables task-specific optimization of synaptic plasticity, where large DR supports classification accuracy and high linearity benefits analog computing. These findings establish Eu-based 2-D perovskites as a lead-free, reliable platform for low-power ReRAM and high-fidelity neuromorphic systems."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have shown remarkable success in many applications, yet their high energy consumption limits their practicability. Recent studies incorporated energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to build Spiking DRL methods and lower energy consumption by setting a shorter simulation duration for SNNs to compute fewer gradients. However, these existing Spiking DRL methods fail to sample sufficient high-quality samples within a fixed-size replay buffer and perform poorly when the simulation duration is small, introducing the challenging tradeoff between energy consumption and model performance. Motivated by such observations, we develop a generic resilient experience replay method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing spiking DRL methods to effectively address the above tradeoff. Specifically, we allow the replay buffer to dynamically expand as the number of training samples increases, thereby accommodating more potentially valuable candidate samples for policy training. Meanwhile, we introduce an adaptive approach to manage the buffer size by determining when to shrink the replay buffer and removing redundant samples automatically. This strategy prevents the buffer from expanding unnecessarily, thereby mitigating the potential negative impact on model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the performance of five state-of-the-art (SOTA) spiking DRL methods across various simulation durations in sixteen tasks, in terms of return, without compromising their energy efficiency."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tce.2025.3642942",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In the recent past, wearable consumer health devices have increasingly integrated AI-driven neuro-monitoring systems for real-time migraine detection using EEG signals. However, existing methodologies rely heavily on centralized deep learning models and static classifiers that are computationally intensive and highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, signal noise, and inter-subject variability. These limitations result in degraded performance in real-world environments, poor generalization, and high latency—making them unsuitable for continuous health monitoring in resource-constrained wearable devices. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel, Adversarial Attack-Resistant AI-enabled Wearable EEG Framework for real-time migraine monitoring. The proposed system introduces a Dual-Defense Adversarial Learning Network (DD-ALNet), which integrates a Lightweight Temporal Convolutional Network (L-TCN) for efficient signal modeling and an Adversarial Noise Discriminator (AND) trained via generative adversarial learning to detect and suppress perturbations. Furthermore, a Low-Power Federated Incremental Learning Algorithm (L-FILA) has been developed to enable adaptive learning on-device, ensuring privacy preservation and reducing communication overhead. The framework achieves a 21% improvement in adversarial robustness, an 18% reduction in false positive rate, and a 26% decrease in power consumption, validated across real-time migraine EEG datasets under both clean and adversarial conditions. These findings show that the suggested structure greatly improves the sustainability and dependability of medical monitoring systems. Clinical decision-making and patient confidence are enhanced by the 18% decrease in false positive rate, which reduces needless alarms and diagnostic errors. Longer device uptime and continuous, non-intrusive patient monitoring in wearable applications are made possible by the 26% reduction in power consumption. The novelty lies in the fusion of dual-layer adversarial defense, on-device federated adaptation, and energy-efficient AI deployment. Deliverables include comparative tables for performance metrics (accuracy, FPR, robustness), adversarial resistance evaluation, and smooth spline graphs showing model trends under varying attack intensities."

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances, which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected quaternion is then used to compute the UAV’s heading. An adaptive process noise covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances, a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation under magnetically disturbed conditions."

Traditional detection methods are labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, often delaying effective intervention. This study proposes an automated tomato crop health monitoring system using deep learning, specifically the ResNet101V2 architecture with transfer learning, to detect both foliar and fruit diseases. The model was trained and evaluated on three datasets: the PlantVillage dataset with approximately 16,000 annotated tomato leaf images across ten classes, a 7226-image fruit dataset with four categories (Unripe, Ripe, Old, Damaged), and a custom three-class fruit dataset (Reject, Ripe, Unripe) containing 2400 images. Preprocessing techniques such as contrast enhancement, sharpening, and normalization were applied to improve feature extraction, while augmentations like rotation, zoom, and brightness adjustment enhanced model robustness. Performance was measured using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The ResNet101V2 model achieved 93.29% accuracy on the leaf dataset, 97.65% on the four-class fruit dataset within 60 epochs, and 92.50% on the three-class dataset using only preprocessing—surpassing augmentation-based results. These findings demonstrate the model’s robustness, efficiency, and potential for practical deployment in intelligent crop health monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Advanced computer memory is crucial for artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern recognition. As the demand for high-density, low-power, and non-volatile memory grows, conductive-bridge RAM (CBRAM) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional memory technologies. CBRAM operates by forming and dissolving metallic filaments, enabling resistive switching between a low-resistance state (LRS) and a high-resistance state (HRS). However, its susceptibility to radiation-induced failures limits its use in harsh environments, such as in aerospace, oil and gas and defense applications. To address this, we propose a radiation-hardened CBRAM cell using Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) to enhance fault tolerance. A 1T1R (one-transistor, one-resistor) architecture was implemented for controlled switching, and a 4×4 CBRAM array was developed to evaluate its scalability. Analyzing SET and RESET operations under transient conditions, a Verilog-A model was simulated in Cadence Virtuoso. The results show that TMR effectively reduces single-cell failures, achieving 100% fault coverage through a majority-voter circuit, and also improving data integrity and reliability in radiation-prone environments. Also, challenges such as leakage currents and power overhead were analyzed, highlighting the importance of further optimization. Overall, our research demonstrates that CBRAM, when boosted with TMR, is a strong and radiation-resistant memory option, suitable for use in demanding environments."

The structure and working principle of HSE are described, and the characteristics of HSE are analyzed. A drive and control method of HSE is proposed based on an MCU chip, and the drive control circuit is designed. To investigate the influence of MIG on HSE performance, an experimental platform was established. By changing the frequency and duty cycle of driving signals, the effects of MIG on coil current, armature displacement, armature motion lag, and current response time were studied. Experimental results indicate that when frequency changes, MIG reduces the average coil current variation and energy loss by 9.7% , and increases the average armature displacement variation by 21.6% . However, the average armature motion lag and current response time remain essentially consistent. When the duty cycle changes, MIG reduces the average coil current variation and energy loss by 8.2% , decreases the average armature displacement variation by 16.9% , reduces the average armature motion lag phase angle by 16.8% , and shortens the current response time by 6.7% . It can be seen that MIG can improve the performance of HSE. This article proposes a novel optimization method that is significant for enhancing HSE performance."

We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface."

    "abstract": "Genetic programming (GP) has achieved promising results without relying on the extraction of prior knowledge, e.g., fixed network architecture. However, most existing GP methods guide the evolutionary process by optimizing only the fitness function. In the few-shot image classification task, this single optimization approach can cause the model to converge prematurely to a local optimum, resulting in overfitting. Recently, knowledge learning-assisted evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated remarkable performance by making full use of evolutionary information to guide the evolutionary process. However, existing methods cannot be directly applied to a GP-based method. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Probabilistic Genetic Programming with Knowledge Learning (POGP). Specifically, we design the Redress-Forget Mechanism of External Archiving to explore the potential of global information and to re-update external archives using a validation set, effectively utilizing evolutionary information while maintaining population diversity. Furthermore, the Probabilistic Initialization Strategy is designed to initialize the population using evolutionary information when it falls into a local optimum, aiming to enhance the population’s exploration ability. Moreover, we introduce Knowledge Learning-guide Evo-operations to improve the algorithm’s ability to develop optimal solutions by fusing local and global information to guide the population’s search direction. The experiments on benchmark datasets indicate that POGP outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based and GP-based methods in almost all comparisons, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed POGP framework."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated in several optimization, scheduling, orchestration as well as in native communication network functions. This paradigm shift results in increased energy consumption, however, quantifying the end-to-end energy consumption of adding intelligence to communication systems remains an open challenge since conventional energy consumption metrics focus on either communication, computation infrastructure, or model development. To address this, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AI Lifecycle (eCAL) of an AI model in a system. eCAL captures the energy consumption throughout the development, deployment and utilization of an AI-model providing intelligence in a communication network by (i) analyzing the complexity of data collection and manipulation in individual components and (ii) deriving overall and per-bit energy consumption. We show that as a trained AI model is used more frequently for inference, its energy cost per inference decreases, since the fixed training energy is amortized over a growing number of inferences. For a simple case study we show that eCAL for 100 inferences is 2.73 times higher than for 1000 inferences. Additionally, we have developed a modular and extendable opensource simulation tool to enable researchers, practitioners, and engineers to calculate the end-to-end energy cost with various configurations and across various systems, ensuring adaptability to diverse use cases."

    "abstract": "Maintaining adequate bus inertia is crucial for frequency stability of power systems with high penetration of inertia-less variable renewable energy sources (VRES). Currently, the methods used for generation scheduling either overlook the inertia constraint or assume an aggregated model of the system inertia, where the total inertia is represented as if the entire power system is a single equivalent generator. Ignoring the spatial distribution of inertia across a network can lead to local frequency instability. This paper proposes optimization framework for maximizing inertia-less VRES penetration and minimizing transmission power loss while considering the inertia distribution constraint. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is applied to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. Two frequency stability indices i) the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and ii) frequency nadir based on the multi-area model of the modified IEEE 39 bus test system, were used for validation. All the simulations were conducted using MATLAB integrated with Matpower."

Unlike land-based seismic stations, where sensors can be manually adjusted to be level, the sensors in the OBS may tilt, which can affect the quality of recorded seismic signals. To accurately record seismic waves, it is essential to automatically adjust the sensor on the seafloor to be level. This study designed a Gimbal system that can automatically adjust the level using dc motors. At predetermined intervals, the system detects the sensor’s tilt angle and adjusts the level to nearly 0°. Unlike the traditional Gimbal system’s braking mechanism, this study uses the self-locking action of a worm gear and a worm wheel, combined with a high-friction mechanism, to achieve the braking effect of the Gimbal system. This article explores the resonant frequency of the Gimbal system, firmware control, assembly requirements, testing conditions, and compares the data differences between marine OBS and land-based seismographs."

In this method, RIS elements are partitioned to concurrently apply the CSI-based OPS and CSI-free random phase shift (RPS), achieving significant latency reduction compared to OPS systems that demand full CSI. We derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable rate, average decoding error probability, and average delay under the finite blocklength regime, and further provide insights by asymptotic analysis.

Conventional fault diagnosis methods often rely on single-source data, which limits detection accuracy under dynamic conditions. This study presents an AI-based multi-source fault diagnosis approach using data from vibration, current, sound, and thermal sensors collected under varied load and speed conditions. Raw data was preprocessed, and features were extracted across time, frequency, and time-frequency domains for machine learning (ML) classification. For deep learning (DL), the sensor data was transformed into scalograms and fused with thermal images, which were then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN). ML models achieved up to 96% accuracy on individual sensors but showed reduced performance with data fusion. In contrast, the CNN with fused data achieved 99.2% accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness of sensor fusion and deep learning in enhancing fault detection reliability and suggest a promising direction for intelligent predictive maintenance systems."

The rotor position detection method is crucial for achieving efficient and stable control of the motor. Existing rotor position detection and control methods have issues such as the position sensor method affecting the effective volume of the mechanism, and back electromotive force (back EMF) detection being inapplicable to low-speed working conditions. This paper utilizes the influence of the saliency effect and saturation effect of the motor magnetic field on motor inductance to design a motor control method for rotor position analysis based on monitoring pulse responses. The method can effectively achieve sensorless rapid acquisition of rotor phase information by monitoring pulse signals through switch tube conduction and combining with inductance responses, reducing the volume of the driving mechanism while ensuring efficient and high-torque control of the motor."

In this paper, we propose DA-MAGPool, a dual-mode density-aware attention-based hierarchical pooling framework that dynamically selects between sparse local attention and multi-hop Personalized PageRank-based attention, conditioned on the input graph’s density. By introducing a learnable threshold to distinguish between sparse and dense graphs, our method adaptively applies the most suitable attention strategy, thereby preserving important local and global structural information. A unified node scoring mechanism is then used for Top-k pooling to retain salient nodes. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets show that DA-MAGPool consistently surpasses existing pooling baselines on four datasets and attains the second-best performance on the remaining one, demonstrating high accuracy across diverse graph classification tasks."

The traditional target detection algorithms still have the problem of insufficient detection accuracy in the face of small size, complex illumination and background interference. To this end, this paper proposes two improvement strategies based on the EfficientDet model: on the one hand, a lightweight Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism is introduced into the BiFPN feature fusion module to enhance the ability to pay attention to important features; on the other hand, the original IoU loss function is replaced by the GIoU loss with stronger geometrical constraints, so as to improve the model’s regression accuracy on target bounding box regression accuracy. Experiments on a public airport traffic sign dataset demonstrate that the improved model effectively improves the detection accuracy and small target recognition capability while maintaining a small number of parameters and inference speed. The method in this paper provides new ideas and feasible solutions for real-time traffic sign recognition tasks in airport scenarios."

The model combines five neural network types, including attention-based LSTMs, Bayesian networks, and Monte Carlo Dropout, to measure both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. A cost-aware rejection rule is used to avoid unreliable predictions. Experiments on large banking, e-commerce, and telecom datasets reached 94.2% accuracy and reduced intervention costs by 18.3% compared to baseline models.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, plant disease detection relied on labor-intensive visual inspection. With the rise of precision agriculture, machine learning methods have gained traction for automated detection but require large labeled datasets, which are often difficult to collect due to disease rarity and annotation costs. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces a realistic data augmentation method based on statistical analysis of apple leaf lesions infected by apple scab, using the publicly available PlantVillage dataset. The method reconstructs the color texture of disease lesions by analyzing their statistical and color space properties. Lesion distribution masks are created at various scales to simulate a range of lesion sizes and spatial patterns. Smooth transitions and natural appearances are achieved by gradually blurring lesion boundaries using a Gaussian function. The leaf skeleton is extracted through a median-based approach to place lesions at anatomically plausible locations, resulting in visually realistic synthetic images. These synthetic lesions are then fused with healthy leaf images by pixel-wise multiplication to generate realistic diseased samples. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated using the SegNet architecture and the F1-score as the evaluation metric. Experimental results show that pretraining the model on synthetic images and fine-tuning with real data improves the F1-score by 25% compared to training solely on real data. This method offers a practical solution to the challenge of data scarcity in plant health monitoring and smart agriculture."

Even brief service disruptions can lead to failed transactions, customer dissatisfaction, and significant financial loss. Accurate and timely detection of service anomalies is thus vital for operational resilience and customer trust.We present a method to quantify lost transactions and compute perceived availability in banking switches by reconstructing expected transaction-per-second (TPS) demand patterns. Outage and load-drop intervals are first detected by comparing the target day’s TPS wave against a reference wave built from neighboring days. We then model both real and expected TPS using a Poisson framework to generate demand estimate patterns. The gap between the reconstructed and observed waves yields counts of missed transactions and an end-user-centric availability metric.Evaluation on real bank data demonstrates that our approach effectively uncovers faults and provides accurate availability estimates. Compared to a baseline method, our technique reduced the mean squared error by 9.1%, and lowered false positive rates in anomaly detection from 13.3% to 8.7%, while maintaining high sensitivity."

Traditional MAC units based on the decimal number system rely on conventional multipliers, such as Booth multipliers or Wallace tree multipliers, which suffer from high carry propagation delays and increased power consumption due to sequential arithmetic operations. This work addresses the issue by proposing a Vinculum number system based MAC unit, an unconventional arithmetic approach derived from Vedic mathematics. We implemented a 32-bit Vinculum Vedic MAC unit, which achieves a 47.55% reduction in power consumption and 20.11% reduction in propagation delay, with an overhead of 5.77% in area consumption. Furthermore, the improvement in Power–Delay Product (PDP) of 58.1% highlights the design’s capability to deliver faster computations with lower energy per operation, making it suitable for high-speed, low-power applications."

    "abstract": "Designing energy harvesters capable of operating at low frequencies and across a broad bandwidth is a key challenge in vibration energy harvesting. This paper presents the structural design, finite element modeling, and performance analysis of a novel spiral-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH). An electromechanical coupling model is built through the finite element analysis method to evaluate the electromechanical response of the proposed PEH under harmonic excitation. Modal analysis reveals that the first three resonant frequencies of the proposed structure are closely spaced, enhancing its capability for broadband energy harvesting in the low-frequency range (15–30 Hz). Frequency response analysis demonstrates that different excitation angles significantly affect the voltage and power output. At an excitation angle of 112.5°, the energy harvester achieves a maximum output power of 244 μW under an excitation level of 0.1g. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed PEH design in low-frequency vibration energy harvesting applications."

    "abstract": "China's drive towards clean energy, especially the expansion of deep-sea offshore wind farms, has highlighted the potential of floating wind turbines. These turbines can effectively harness abundant wind resources and offer flexible deployment options, making them a promising technology. However, they also generate more pronounced wake effects, which challenge traditional wake models and lead to inaccurate power output predictions. Additionally, the inherent volatility of wind power necessitates robust energy storage solutions to stabilize output and enhance the adoption of renewable energy. This study presents an advanced wake model specifically designed for floating wind turbines, significantly improving the accuracy of power forecasts in wind farms. It also introduces a smart operational strategy for a hybrid electricity-hydrogen storage system, utilizing Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to optimally distribute stored power. Testing has shown that the new wake model provides predictions that closely match real-world data. Furthermore, the hybrid storage system reduces peak 10-minute power fluctuations from 5.8 MW to 3.9 MW, achieving a 32.76% smoothing effect."

We introduce a universal calibration framework based on an Iterative Best Match (IBM) algorithm that refines alignment by optimizing correspondences between sensors, eliminating traditional point-to-point matching. IBM naturally extends to simultaneous camera-LiDAR-radar calibration and leverages tracked natural targets (e.g., pedestrians) to establish cross-modal correspondences without predefined calibration markers. Experiments on a realistic multi-sensor platform (fisheye-camera, LiDAR, and radar) and the KITTI dataset validate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our method."

In crawl spaces, current proprioceptive locomotion learning methods are difficult to achieve traverse because only ground features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised RL framework for proprioceptive locomotion in crawl spaces is proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's collision states as well as ground and spatial features for locomotion. A point cloud feature extraction method is proposed to supervise the state estimation network. The method uses representation of the point cloud in polar coordinate frame and MLPs for efficient feature extraction. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, our method exhibits faster iteration time in the training and more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of legged robots to traverse constrained spaces without requiring exteroceptive sensors."

However, the spatio-temporal uncertainty of underwater acoustic networks and the presence of multiple collision domains pose severe challenges to MAC-layer scheduling and interference management. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive scheduling MAC protocol based on channel sensing and reinforcement decision-making (CSRD-ASMAC), aiming to provide an efficient and adaptive transmission scheduling scheme for D-IoUT. The protocol first introduces a hierarchical channel-state classification framework to accurately characterize the channel environment for each slot. Building on pre-divided basic slots, it integrates channel sensing and slot prediction into a reinforcement learning framework and employs a mixed-action exploration strategy to update Q-values, enabling each node to adaptively select the optimal transmission slot. Simulation results show that CSRD-ASMAC effectively improves overall network throughput in multi-collision domain environments."

The digital side covers the CAD models and kinematic model of the crane, and provides services for optimal control, historical data logging, data visualization and continuous validation. We used this setup as use case in several previous publications where its functionality was validated.

This paper proposes a complete predictive maintenance experimental process combining artificial intelligence technology, including six main links: data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, model selection, SHAP analysis, and result visualization. By comparing and analyzing the performance of eight machine learning models, it is found that integrated learning methods such as XGBoost and random forest perform well in milling machine fault prediction tasks. In addition, with the help of SHAP analysis technology, the influence mechanism of different features on equipment failure is deeply revealed, among which processing temperature, torque and speed are the key factors affecting failure. This study combines artificial intelligence and manufacturing technology, provides a methodological reference for predictive maintenance practice in an intelligent manufacturing environment, and has practical significance for promoting the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry, improving production efficiency and reducing maintenance costs."

    "abstract": "With the advent of new multi-partner, federated avionics projects for developing next-generation aircraft, there is increased pressure from the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) to enhance development speed, a practice known as “deliver-at-pace” [6]. This presents a challenge at both the technical and organisational levels, necessitating a move from the current heavily document-based and manual development process to a more agile and automated approach. Furthermore, the organisational culture must shift from a tool-centric mindset to a more data and knowledge-oriented one. Initiatives like openCAESAR have addressed this through the Integrated Model-Centric Engineering (IMCE) practice [8], which lays out principles for effective Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). The solution proposed in this paper builds on this work, implementing these principles to create the Integrated Knowledge-Centric Engineering (IKCE) methodology, a framework for designing a modern engineering enterprise. The goal of this methodology is to solve limitations in current development processes by reducing tool reliance and increasing automation. This allows an organisation to decrease development effort, accelerate verification, and protect against vendor lock-in. Adopting IKCE will aid in achieving the MOD’s “deliver-at-pace” requirements without sacrificing the rigour of the development process. By achieving this, upgrades can be implemented at a far faster pace than historically possible, moving away from rigid development processes to an inherently agile way of working. Doing this will have long-lasting benefits of the ability for future projects to change direction. This paper discusses the functions of IKCE “workspaces” and their user interactions. It uses the FireSat II satellite case study [11] to demonstrate the requirements gathering process within IKCE, showing how the framework handles various development aspects in a practical example."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of lung cancer subtypes from histopathological images is challenging due to limited labelled data and high visual similarity between classes. This limitation is especially critical in clinical diagnostics, where timely and accurate classification can impact treatment decisions. To address this, LungCLR presents a comprehensive evaluation of a two-stage framework that combines contrastive self-supervised learning with EfficientNet-B3 for effective feature extraction. In the first stage, the SimCLR framework is employed to pretrain the encoder on unlabeled histopathology images, enabling it to learn meaningful representations by distinguishing subtle morphological variations. A projection head is incorporated to optimise the NT-Xent loss during training. In the second stage, a lightweight classification head is attached and fine-tuned using small labelled subsets, as few as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0}$</tex> samples per class. Finally, partial end-to-end fine-tuning is applied to further enhance performance. LungCLR is evaluated on the LC25000 dataset, which includes three tissue categories: benign, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Using the full dataset, the proposed model achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.97 %, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, even under low data conditions, the model performs robustly, reaching 90.03% accuracy with only 100 labelled samples per class. These results highlight the effectiveness of established contrastive learning techniques when carefully applied in a clinically relevant, lowdata setting."

At the MIL and SIL stages, the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard is commonly used to enable co-simulation of models across different tools, but its use in PIL remains limited. We propose an approach to seamlessly integrate PIL into existing FMI-based co-simulation and testing frameworks. To this end, we develop a prototype backend for the UniFMU framework and leverage synchronous clocks introduced in FMI 3.0 to incorporate the actual execution time of the application into the co-simulation. This enables the reuse of existing MIL and SIL setups for PIL, while making the impact of numerical representation and execution time, measured on the target hardware, visible within the co-simulation."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy is often a time of increased stress and anxiety, both psychologically and physically. More and more research is being done on the calming effects of relaxation techniques on the mother's brain. Passively listening to meditative mantras is one such method. This study investigates neuronal phase synchronization in three distinct cognitive states in pregnant women with their eyes closed: resting state (RS), mantra listening (M), and after mantra listening (AM). 32 scalp electrodes and a 128 Hz sampling rate were used to collect EEG data from 43 pregnant subjects. There were two 2-minute trials in each state. To assess the temporal synchrony of brain oscillations, the Inter-Trial Coherence (ITC), a phase-locking metric that quantifies the stability of neural phase over multiple trials, was computed. Bandpass filtering followed by Hilbert transform was used to assess ITC across the Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–13 Hz), and Beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands. The Mantra condition had the greatest mean ITC, according to the results: 0.9117 (Theta), 0.8891 (Alpha), and 0.8083 (Beta). Conversely, the After-Mantra condition displayed moderate ITC levels of 0.6582 (Theta), 0.6510 (Alpha), and 0.6437 (Beta), whereas the Resting State produced 0.6392 (Theta), 0.6381 (Alpha), and 0.6368 (Beta). According to these results, passive mantra listening improves brain phase synchrony, especially in the lower frequency bands, and could be a useful non-invasive method of meditative pregnant relaxation."

Accurate depth estimation is critical when facial morphology is used to register these diverse image modalities. This work presents a depth estimation system that integrates the Intel D405 stereo camera with a modified HITNet architecture, enhanced by a face attention mechanism to improve facial reconstruction. On synthetic data (MetaHuman), the method reduces mean absolute error from 2.29 mm to 2.02 mm; on real multi-camera data (D405 and ZED 2i), it lowers error from 16.91 mm to 14.39 mm, and to 13.85 mm using the weights from the synthetic training. These results highlight the value of domain-specific models and synthetic data for accurate facial depth capture in neurosurgical imaging workflows."

This paper presents a traveling wave-based protection method tailored for distribution networks, addressing the challenges posed by fault detection in complex configurations. The proposed protection strategy utilizes voltage measurements at key nodes across the network, applying a time-domain signal processing technique using the Hilbert Transform (HT). A novel frequency modification algorithm is introduced to enhance the accuracy of fault detection and classification, compensating for severe coupling between the phases typically encountered in distribution systems. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 100% accuracy in fault detection, classification, and section identification, with an average fault location estimation error of approximately 0.06%. Furthermore, the scheme operates with low computational burden and is robust under varying fault conditions, including resistance, inception angle, location, and fault type variations. Simulation results highlight the efficiency of this approach in providing real-time, accurate fault management, making it a promising solution for the protection of distribution networks."

ERC couples a dedicated emotion detection module with a domain risk module and a vision-language policy to generate transparent, just-in-time guidance. We evaluate ERC in a controlled trading task with four between-subjects conditions (dashboard baseline, visiononly, ERC-noEPE, ERC-Full). Although there is no real financial loss, participants reported above-midpoint perceived stress in early rounds, indicating non-trivial affective engagement. ERC achieved high usability (SUS =84.37) and reduced absolute EPE over six rounds, indicating improved affect calibration and decision consistency. Exploratory ablations benchmark ERC against (i) a dashboard baseline, (ii) a unimodal vision-only pipeline, and (iii) ERC without EPE (same interface). ERC-Full consistently yielded the largest drop in |EPE| and higher decision consistency, suggesting that EPE contributes beyond interface and unimodal effects."

    "abstract": "Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it significantly improves survival rates by facilitating timely and effective treatment. Lung cancer often begins as bronchial lesions developing along the airway walls. Bronchoscopy is the minimally invasive method of choice for detecting such lesions. Currently, three complementary bronchoscopic video modalities have been utilized for this purpose: white-light bronchoscopy (WLB), narrow-band imaging (NBI), and autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB). Unfortunately, current practice forces the clinician to manually examine each video source and later interactively correlate the results of these exams to make final lesion decisions. Because of the lack of effective tools for multimodal endoscopic video analysis, this proves to be an extremely time-consuming, error-prone process, making it impractical for common clinical use. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal video analysis and synchronization system that enables efficient analysis of multimodal bronchoscopic videos for early cancer lesion detection. The system provides methods for planning and guiding a straightforward multimodal airway exam through the major airways. Subsequent video processing methods then draw on deep-learning-based techniques to identify candidate single-mode bronchial lesions. Next, a synchronization/registration pipeline registers all bronchoscopic video data to a reference 3D airway tree model derived from a patient's X-ray computed tomography (CT) scan. This finally facilitates interactive graphical visualization and interaction with all processed multimodal data. Results with lung cancer patient studies indicate the system's promise for efficient, effective video analysis and lesion detection."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among women. Estimating an individual's risk of developing breast cancer plays a critical role in early detection, which significantly enhances treatment success and survival rates. In addition to being a known risk factor, breast density also reduces the sensitivity of mammography due to its masking effect, making tumors harder to detect. This paper presents a comprehensive system designed for early breast cancer risk estimation, comprising two interconnected systems: a breast cancer risk estimation system and a breast density estimation system. The breast cancer risk estimation system employs the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) Risk Factors dataset to train various machine learning (ML) models. Among these, the decision tree-based algorithms achieved high performance, with decision tree achieving a testing accuracy of 93.40% and an F 1 -score of 0.9345. The breast density estimation system utilizes the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) to assess breast density. A clustering-based approach was implemented, with agglomerative clustering yielding the best results, achieving a testing accuracy of 81.25% and a silhouette coefficient of 0.70. By integrating advanced ML techniques, the proposed system facilitates proactive patient screening and preventive care, ultimately contributing to improved breast health outcomes."

When islanding occurs, there is uncertainty in the system topology and operation mode. Aiming at the problems of large modeling workload and large dynamic variability in the modeling process when distributed generation sources with different locations, quantities, and capacities in the region are accessed, a multistep subgroup equivalent modeling method based on topology analysis of distributed generation source distribution is proposed. First, the topology of distributed generation distribution is considered, the degree of node electrical coupling is analyzed, and the regions are divided according to the node voltage sensitivity matrix and the region clustering identification number is defined. Secondly, the distributed area clustering identification number is incorporated into the division index, and the corresponding dynamic characteristic parameters are selected as the clustering index according to the distributed generation categories to complete the division of distributed generation clusters. Finally, the equivalence model of distributed generation supply is established based on the idea of homotopy equivalence, and it is verified through simulation of Island System that the multi-step clustering method and the established equivalence model proposed in the paper are reasonable and effective."

In this paper, a data-driven natural aging model is proposed to predict the output power of PV modules and estimate the expected degradation values of single-diode model (SDM) parameters, which can serve as references for identifying performance degradation and specific fault types. Firstly, a cumulative damage model is incorporated to quantify the effects of environmental stressors—namely module temperature, cycling temperature, relative humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiance—on the natural aging of PV modules, and a degradation model describing the power degradation rate as a function of time and climatic stress is established, and its unknown parameters are identified using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, the power degradation rate is introduced as a decay factor to derive the expected values of SDM parameters under natural aging conditions. The proposed model is validated using data from the Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre (DKASC), and the results confirm its effectiveness. This work provides a reference for PV module health assessment and fault classification."

First, a comprehensive performance index system is constructed, considering modularity, power matching degree, and cluster node count metrics, with an improved genetic algorithm employed for cluster partitioning. Second, a distributed control approach based on the synchronous alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) is implemented, with voltage deviation, network losses, and PV curtailment as the objective functions. Finally, simulation analysis is conducted on a real 10kV distribution system, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method excels in promoting PV accommodation and reducing computational complexity, validating the effectiveness of the cluster partitioning approach and distributed control strategy."

On this basis, an optimization model is established with the objective of minimizing the cost items such as the annual comprehensive cost of the system including the annual value investment such as equipment, natural gas purchase, and grid interaction, etc., and the cost function of the system is optimally solved in the MATLAB environment by combining Yalmip and Gurobi.

    "abstract": "Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) therapy is a novel treatment for ventricular tachycardia that delivers a high radiation dose to a target volume in the myocardium. Recent publications have recommended the use of cardiorespiratory motion management strategies to prevent damage to nearby critical structures in addition to the commonly applied 5 mm margin of delivery uncertainty in radiation planning. Motion capture in 3D cardiac ultrasound (US) could be utilized for passive and active motion management due to its capability of capturing cardiac motion in 3D with a sufficient frame rate, and due to its advantages like small hardware components as well as real time capability. The transfer of patient-specific cardiorespiratory motion trajectories from US to computed tomography (CT) coordinates for the purpose of radiation plan adaptation presents a novel use-case that necessitates the combination of multiple image processing methods. In this work, we present a framework for motion capture in US developed for the evaluation of a clinical study. 3D/3D registrations of Cartesian and anatomic representations based on a spherical harmonics shape model are evaluated utilizing a human phantom dataset as well as seven patient datasets. Overall numeric results indicate accuracies of less than 5 mm error, and the use of the anatomic shape modelling increases tracking precision. Integration of patient-specific trajectories of the target or critical structures in CT could already be used for passive motion management in STAR therapy. The implemented framework has the potential to increase precision and safety of the therapy and to be further developed into an active motion management system in the future."

    "abstract": "In cross-organizational software engineering, every model managed may contain intellectual property (IP). That IP must be protected from potential competitors, who may also be fellow collaborators. To that end, organizations use access control systems to manage access to the parts of a model or the model as a whole as part of their model management efforts. However, access control systems often need to be shared, thereby potentially compromising the IP protection in place. In this paper, we introduce DEBAC, an approach for using the rules of role-based access control to derive encryption rules. We are able to circumvent the sharing of access control systems by using instead the encryption of model deltas (i.e., arbitrary changes to a model). To evaluate our approach, we generate use cases from open source GitHub repositories (committers being regarded as collaborating organizations) and show evidence for the functionality and applicability of the DEBAC approach. With the DEBAC approach, we can derive the encryption rules to be able to store any model on any untrusted infrastructure while still being able to preserve IP."

Predicting the optimal growth temperature based on the physical properties of the genome allows for estimation without the need to culture newly discovered species. In this context, developing methods that infer an organism's ideal growth temperature from genomic sequence data represents an important approach for improving efficiency in both time and resource management. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that leverages the structural parallels between tRNA sequences and natural language through transformerbased models. The approach comprises three main components: (i) generating embedding vectors from tRNA sequences using transformer-based encoders, (ii) storing and retrieving these embeddings within a vector-based database via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, and (iii) performing a regression task using a large language model (LLM) based on the retrieved sequences, enhanced with explainable AI techniques to provide interpretable predictions.

Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex—specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication—can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically-observed functional-connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully-connected models, G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations."

    "abstract": "Interpreting extended, untrimmed videos by dividing them into meaningful action segments is fundamental for automated analysis of human activities. While modern models can represent long-range temporal dependencies, they often lack explicit mechanisms that encourage consecutive frames to follow coherent label progressions. We formulate segmentation as an energy-optimization problem composed of two parts: (i) a data term derived from frame-wise class likelihoods and (ii) a temporal regularization term that encourages coherent and semantically meaningful transitions between labels. Data costs are derived from a diffusion-based generative model (DiffAct) to capture action probabilities, while smoothness costs enforce semantic coherence by modeling valid transitions between action labels. The resulting discrete objective is optimized via α-β swap graph-cut moves. Results obtained on the GTEA dataset reveal that GBSO surpasses competitive baselines by providing more accurate segmentations and notably steadier temporal behavior, reflected in sharper action boundaries and reduced fragmentation. These outcomes demonstrate that embedding semantic transition structure within a data-centric segmentation approach leads to more reliable temporal predictions."

The framework incorporates 20 linguistic features capturing domain-specific patterns to handle severe class imbalance where minority classes are substantially underrepresented. Experimental validation on the Davidson hate speech dataset demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 91.57% and weighted-averaged F1-scores of 93.73%.

In the day-ahead stage, a multi-scenario approach is employed to characterize renewable energy uncertainties and formulate an economically optimal scheduling plan. In the intraday stage, a two-layer rolling optimization model is developed, incorporating load fluctuations and leveraging the temporal and spatial coupling characteristics of electricity, thermal, and cold to achieve real-time multi-energy coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively smooth supply-demand fluctuations and significantly enhance the economic performance and operational stability of VPPs while ensuring users’ energy demands are met."

    "abstract": "Due to the increasing demand for mobile data, mobile network operators typically rely on cell densification to meet sufficient network capacity. However, doing so also introduces increased interference (ICI), leading to diminishing returns in terms of spectral efficiency and making further capacity enhancements challenging. This paper explores the bandwidth block assignment method for ICI mitigation. The core idea of this research is to divide the operational bandwidth of an NR carrier into two partially overlapping bandwidth parts (BWP) to reduce the impact of ICI. By partially overlapping the two BWPs, they are allowed to share the same Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), and therefore, the same attach and handover configurations. A modified Kernighan-Lin algorithm is utilized to strategically assign the bandwidth blocks to each gNB to maximize the spatial distance between cells sharing the same operational bandwidth. The performance of this approach has been evaluated by using NS-3 and 5G-LENA simulations in a 24-gNB urban macro scenario with the topology based on a realworld commercial deployment. Simulation results show that the method improves the average throughput by 32.3 % compared to the uniform-block configuration with the same operational bandwidth size, indicating an improvement in spectral efficiency. Moreover, the 75th percentile Block Error Rate (BLER) of 62.50 % in the uniform 60 MHz configuration is reduced to just 16.70 % when split-block is applied, demonstrating a significant gain in reliability."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) sensing is attracting interest in research, standardization, and industry, especially for its potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By leveraging the properties of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) waves used in wireless networks, RF sensing captures environmental information such as the presence and movement of people and objects, enabling passive localization and vision applications. This paper investigates the theoretical bounds on accuracy and resolution for RF sensing systems within dense networks. It employs an EM model to predict the effects of body blockage in various scenarios. To detect human movements, the paper proposes a deep graph neural network, trained on Received Signal Strength (RSS) samples generated from the EM model. These samples are structured as dense graphs, with nodes representing antennas and edges as radio links. Focusing on the problem of identifying the number of human subjects co-present in a monitored area over time, the paper analyzes the theoretical limits on the number of distinguishable subjects, exploring how these limits depend on factors such as the number of radio links, the size of the monitored area and the subjects physical dimensions. These bounds enable the prediction of the system performance during network pre-deployment stages. The paper also presents the results of an indoor case study, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and confirm the model’s predictive potential in the network design stages."

However, as the voltage and current ratings of SiC power modules increase, their power density escalates significantly, exacerbating thermal nonuniformity within the modules. This article proposes a regionalized multi-objective optimization method that explicitly addresses thermal nonuniformity, alongside module thermal resistance and pumping power. The methodology integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) with finite element analysis (FEA). Using the Pin-Fin heatsink of an automotive power module as a case study, an optimized design was developed and validated through a back-to-back test platform. Experimental results show that, compared to the traditional Pin-Fin heatsink, the optimized design achieves a 43.7% improvement in thermal uniformity, a 6.2% reduction in thermal resistance, and a 9.8% decrease in pumping power—without added costs."

However, it is not yet clear how to assess and compare current and future solutions for multi-model consistency checking with regarding to confidentiality. Therefore, this paper introduces a formalized system model for confidentialitypreserving consistency checking. A formalization of the confidentiality preservation capability of such a system model is proposed to assess whether a given consistency checking system prevents unauthorized information leakage under specific assumptions. Based on these definitions and formalizations, we present an assessment method where an abstract system model is derived from either an implemented or conceptualized consistency checking system, and our confidentiality formalization is applied to assess the system’s guarantees for model data confidentiality. Our approach provides system and software engineers with a structured method to assess the confidentiality preservation capability regarding model data in their multi-model consistency checking systems, helping them to identify potential weaknesses and guiding improvements to enhance confidentiality where needed. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we apply it to an existing prototype of a partly confidentialitypreserving consistency checking system, as well as two improved versions, assessing their confidentiality preservation strengths and areas for improvement."

Despite their critical role in modern software development, CI/CD pipelines are particularly susceptible to the challenges posed by the proliferation of diverse technologies, especially during adoption and migration.In this paper, we introduce a model-driven methodology designed to abstract away the tool-specific complexities typically encountered in CI/CD pipelines. Our approach begins with an empirical analysis of open-source software repositories to identify patterns and practices in the usage of various CI/CD tools in real-world projects.From this analysis, we derived a metamodel that captures the base concepts and structures common to a wide range of CI/CD technologies. This metamodel forms the basis of a model-driven framework that allows users to define CI/CD pipelines at a higher level of abstraction, independent of any specific tool or platform.To operationalize our approach, we developed a commandline interface capable of generating user interfaces directly from the metamodel. Building on this, we designed a block-based visual language aligned with the metamodel, enabling users to construct CI/CD pipelines visually. These visual models can then be automatically translated into platform-specific configuration files, supporting multiple CI/CD systems.Our solution is especially beneficial in migration scenarios, where transitioning between different CI/CD tools can be both timely and error-prone. By automating the generation of configuration artifacts and providing semantic mappings across tools, our approach significantly reduces the manual effort and complexity involved in such migrations."

Utilizing overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings from a cohort of 44 subjects, our hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture, enhanced by a multi-head attention fusion module, effectively captures neurophysiological and autonomic biomarkers specific to PTSD, such as REM-related theta activity and HRV dysregulation. The model was rigorously evaluated using subject-wise 10-fold cross-validation, reporting performance metrics as mean ± standard deviation across folds, alongside leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation to ensure robustness. Ablation studies and interpretability analyses, including attention maps, Grad-CAM, and SHAP, reveal that the model prioritizes key features like theta power (4–8 Hz) during REM sleep and LF/HF HRV ratios for accurate PTSD classification. Despite the promising results, the modest dataset size highlights the need for larger cohorts to enhance generalizability. This framework offers a scalable, non-invasive solution for clinical diagnostics, with potential integration into wearable devices, thereby paving the way for real-time mental health monitoring while outlining future strategies for enhanced generalization and clinical translation."

    "abstract": "Buildings are the largest energy consumers in cities and play a crucial role in enhancing grid flexibility to facilitate the integration of renewable energy. However, current interaction mechanisms between buildings and distribution networks remain inadequate. To address this gap, this study proposes a centralized- distributed two-tier demand response framework incorporating a carbon trading market, solved through a distributed optimization approach. Case study analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in enabling privacy-preserving, multi-agent building-to-grid interactions for demand response participation. This interaction significantly reduces the operational costs of intelligent buildings and effectively enhances the economic benefits for Distribution Network Operators. Simultaneously, this mechanism coordinates stakeholder interests, increases all participants' proactive engagement and successfully addresses the distribution network's peak shaving requirements."

    "abstract": "Rolling bearing fault diagnosis fundamentally depends on the extraction of periodic impact features. However, accurate extraction of periodic impact features requires numerous high-quality fault samples, which are difficult to obtain in real industrial environments, significantly limiting diagnostic accuracy. To overcome this challenge under small sample conditions, a periodic impact feature enhanced diffusion model (PIFE-DM) is proposed for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. The proposed model integrates a multi-scale residual dilated module and a densely connected module to enhance its sensitivity to the periodic impact features of the fault signals. Additionally, a triple loss function is proposed, which includes the time-domain coherence loss, the impact feature loss, and the dynamic response loss, and effectively preserves the periodic impact features of the fault signals. Experimental validations on simulated signals, CWRU benchmark datasets, and bearing test rig datasets indicate that the PIFE-DM model accurately extracts the periodic impact features from small fault samples, generates high-quality fault signals, and enable effective diagnosis of bearing faults under small sample conditions. Specifically, the PIFE-DM model achieves diagnostic accuracies of 97.00% and 96.33% on the real datasets, the improvements of 4.7% and 6.33% over the original small sample datasets. These results outperform the existing data augmentation methods and highlight the potential of the PIFE-DM model in diagnosing faults under small sample conditions."

    "abstract": "To compensate for the overlooked data realism and physical consistency in traditional cross-machine sample generation methods, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Adaptive Style Transfer Network for Sample Generation in Cross-Machine Small-Sample Fault Diagnosis (PCASTNet) for generating diagnostic samples of the monitored machine under small-sample conditions. PCASTNet employs style transfer to decouple fault content from a reference machine and machine style from the monitored machine. Moreover, it further integrates physical priors by introducing a band energy preservation constraint during sample synthesis. Built upon multi-scale wavelet transform, the framework consists of a wavelet encoder, an Adaptive Style Normalization (AdaSN) module, a wavelet decoder, and a multi-objective loss that jointly constrains content fidelity, style consistency, and energy preservation. Experimental results on two cross-machine scenarios demonstrate that PCASTNet can generate a large number of samples from limited monitored machine data and significantly improves diagnostic accuracy under small-sample conditions."

    "abstract": "Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes. Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention (GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that GeoRepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and low-texture surgical environments."

From 2000 to 2020, PV installations expanded at a compound annual rate of 33%, driven by declining costs (a 90% decline since 2010) and policy. This article explores the economic and technological drivers behind this expansion, including the growth in bifacial and floating PV systems that address land scarcity and boost energy output. It considers integrating PV into smart cities through IoT-based monitoring and AI-driven predictive maintenance, along with regional take-up strategies aligned with geographic and socio-economic realities.

They are employed in multiple biological in-body applications and are still being explored for technological advancements and improvements. A literature review was done to study and address the trade-offs of free-space and implantable meandered antenna designs caused by their smaller physical footprint. This investigation additionally examines the history, current, and recent advances in implantable antenna technology. In this paper, two meandered antenna designs for implantable arm muscle applications were designed: Design A (9.733 mm × 10.80 mm) and Design A (9.85 mm × 5.30 mm). Both antennas' resonant frequency and impedance matching were fine-tuned to around 405 MHz, operating within the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) band (402 - 405 MHz). The two proposed antennas were designed and simulated in a (180 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm) muscle model using the Altair FEKO 3 simulation software. Design A covered a gain of -45 dBi. Design B covered a gain of -35 dBi. The designs were compared and evaluated based on their surface current distribution, antenna resonance, three-dimensional radiation pattern, and more. Theoretical calculations and simulation methods were used to show how Design A and Design B agree with different performance metrics, ultimately proving Design B to have the most outstanding results. It was proven that the trade-off of miniaturization on this design had a less drastic impact on the balance between performance characteristics like impedance matching and antenna gain compared to existing literature."

Unlike conventional RF-based communication, OCC offers enhanced security and cost-effectiveness due to its immunity to electromagnetic interference and compatibility with existing lighting infrastructure. However, the presence of ambient and natural light interference, along with inherent camera noise, often degrades signal accuracy and system performance. To address these challenges, various filtering techniques and camera enhancement methods have been proposed. In this study, we propose a method that relies solely on a smartphone camera to mitigate camera-induced noise using signal filtering techniques and to accurately estimate signal frequency, thereby minimizing the impact of ambient light interference. The proposed approach aims to improve the robustness and reliability of OCC systems in real-world environments."

The composite material is made from jute, coconut fiber, and epoxy resin in a 2:1 epoxy hardener ratio. Vacuum bagging is used to fabricate the composite material due to the availability and suitability of the process. Six layers are formed for each tube, which are tested for its characteristics and mechanical properties. After the fabrication of the four different tube bases was completed, the specimens of each tube were put through mechanical tests following ASTM mechanical testing standards: The Compression test, and the Charpy impact test. The results of the mechanical tests were analyzed to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the jute and coconut fiber composite tube. According to compression tests, the 2J2C2J composite tubes have the highest average maximum force exerted and displacement values followed by the 3C3J composite tube. 2C2J2C composite tube has a low value of maximum force exerted and displacement while 3J3C has a low value of maximum force exerted and high displacement value. CFE and SEA results show that 2J2C2J is a stronger and better material than other composite tubes. According to the Charpy Impact test, 3C3J and 2J2C2J specimens can absorb more impact energy than 3J3C and 2C2J2C specimens. The test's results may be utilized to find the ideal hybrid composition for fibers with better crashworthiness and mechanical qualities."

Anomaly detection identifies irregular behaviors or threats that could compromise vehicle safety and network performance. However, existing methods often struggle with high latency, limited scalability and poor adaptability to dynamic IoV environments. They also face challenges in accurately detecting complex or evolving anomalies due to static models and insufficient context awareness. In this work, a novel model named Exponential Leaf in Wind Optimization-Enabled Siamese Dense Block Capsule Network (ELiWO_SDBCN) is devised for detecting anomalies in Fog-Assisted IoVs. Initially, the Fog-Assisted IoVs Network is simulated and then the recorded log file from the ISCX NSL-KDD dataset is sent for transforming the data, which is performed by Yeo-Johnson transformation to transform the data. Next, features are selected by the mutual information method. Finally, the anomaly detection is performed by SDBCN, where the proposed ELiWO will train the hyperparameters of SDBCN. The ELiWO is derived by incorporating Leaf in Wind Optimization (LiWO) with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). The ELiWO_SDBCN is analyzed by assuming the metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity and F1-Score, that obtained superior values of 92.66%, 92.93% and 92.02%."

To reduce the complexity of solving for the pulse interval, the original problem is transformed into one of determining the predicted impact point (PIP) and the corresponding flight time. Under given conditions of the PIP, pulse interval, and trajectory constraints, the Radau pseudospectral method is employed to search for an optimal set of trajectories. Subsequently, an offline lookup table is employed to calculate the pulse interval. The influence factors on the optimal trajectory are analyzed, and the main variables are determined, which are then used to fit the nonlinear control in the boost phase based on a back propagation neural network. Based on this BPNN, a boost-phase guidance law is developed by incorporating flight path angle feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization capability and robustness."

However, conventional transverse wave devices rely on mechanical cutting of piezoelectric ceramics, resulting in poor consistency. Fabricating lateral electrodes for shear-mode ceramics presents challenges, limiting device miniaturization and large-scale array integration. This work utilized anisotropic lithium niobate (LN) piezoelectric materials and, through microfabrication and laser etching techniques, prepared a 16-channel transverse wave ultrasonic transducer (TWUT) array characterized by small size, wide bandwidth, and high consistency. Furthermore, the influence of in-plane orientation on the shear vibration modes of rectangular array elements was analyzed theoretically based on the Euler transformation method of piezoelectric matrices, and the electromechanical coupling analysis reveals a maximum k<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at a 147° orientation in X-cut LN. Acoustic and electrical characterization showed excellent uniformity across the 16 elements (peak-to-peak amplitude standard deviation of 0.07 V), electrical crosstalk below -40 dB, a -6 dB fractional bandwidth of 36%. To validate the NDT capability of the TWUT array for solid structures, the Total Focusing Method (TFM) was successfully employed to precisely locate multiple Ø2-mm through-hole defects in an aluminum block.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with magnetic sensors are vital for geophysical surveys, environmental monitoring, and target detection. However, magnetic interference from UAV limits their effectiveness. For small platforms like UAVs, space and payload constraints often necessitate installing magnetometers inside the cabin, where interference becomes more complex and intense, rendering the traditional Tolles–Lawson (T-L) model inadequate. To address the issue, this paper proposed a non-parametric compensation paradigm named Physics-embedded Gaussian Process (PeGP). This method is motivated by the statistical characterization of magnetic interference, which reveals that interference approximately follows a Gaussian distribution. To tailor the Gaussian process regression framework to the magnetic compensation problem, the T-L model is incorporated as the mean function to capture the dominant interference component. Simultaneously, a hybrid kernel structure is constructed to jointly handle Euclidean features (like velocity on the R³ space) and manifold features (like attitude on the S³ space). The weights of individual feature kernels are determined based on their correlation with the magnetic interference, enabling a data-informed kernel composition. This design allows PeGP to capture complex interference patterns without requiring large-scale training data by integrating physical priors with data-driven learning. The real flight experiment results demonstrate that PeGP outperforms both classical linear regression compensation methods and state-of-art neural network-based compensation methods."

Critical components of the measurement, including average steady-state temperature and calibration, and their impact on the measurement were explored. The technique was applied to samples consisting of carbon ink coated alumina, glass, and 430 stainless steel substrates, whose wide difference in thermal conductivity induced substantial steady state and calibration variance that accented that source of error. By changing the power offset, the DC temperature was matched, and the variance was diminished. The variance was investigated through the voltage-temperature system relationship, which was predicted and measured. The calibration was then measured directly by equating the voltage and temperature magnitude. Two calibration methods were used, one common and the other novel, and the novel method produced better results, increasing measurement confidence. The measurement was repeated at various power offsets to build the calibration and DC temperature relationship and resulted in a high level of agreement to that derived from the system response. This understanding can help produce more accurate and confident measurements from the non-contact, modulated photothermal radiometry technique."

The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer."

    "abstract": "Parasitic feedthrough is a long-standing limitation in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) resonators, where direct electrical coupling between electrodes masks the mechanical response and reduces the stopband rejection (SBR). The challenge becomes even more severe in liquid environments, where additional coupling paths through the medium further degrade resonance signals, making accurate sensing even more difficult. This work presents a universal feedthrough cancellation technique based on inductive coupling, a natural electromagnetic interaction between parallel conductors. By terminating auxiliary interconnect loops appropriately, the induced current establishes a virtual capacitance of opposite polarity that counteracts the parasitic path, without requiring any modification to the resonator itself. Three implementation strategies are demonstrated, including layout-level interconnects, parallel bond wires, and external loops formed at the PCB level. Across these strategies, the method consistently improves SBR by nearly 20 dB in air and makes previously hidden weak vibrational modes visible. In one case, the proposed cancellation method enables the resonator to reach a notably high SBR of about 57 dB. In liquid, where feedthrough typically dominates, the approach restores distinct resonance peaks and enables stable oscillator operation, giving a frequency resolution of 0.43 Hz. This level of stability shows that suppressing feedthrough enables more reliable oscillation in conditions where the fluid environment strongly affects the resonance. Closed-loop experiments further confirm that the cancellation approach does not affect noise performance or frequency stability. Overall, the results demonstrate that inductive coupling offers a simple, scalable, and packaging-compatible framework for suppressing feedthrough, thereby enhancing the applicability of MEMS resonators in electronics, sensing, and precision measurement across diverse operating conditions.[2025-0193]"

    "abstract": "The integration of Demand Response (DR) programs in modern smart distribution networks has emerged as a strategic approach to enhancing grid reliability, efficiency, and resilience. DR plays a pivotal role in reducing power losses, mitigating voltage deviations, and improving system reliability through the dynamic management of electricity demand. However, the optimal placement of DR programs remains a significant challenge, as improper allocation can lead to increased energy losses and voltage instability. This study presents a multi-objective optimization framework for determining the optimal locations for DR implementation in a standard IEEE 33-bus distribution network, with a particular focus on minimizing power losses, reducing voltage deviation, and decreasing Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS). The network under study incorporates distributed generation (DG) resources, including photovoltaic (PV) units at buses 22 and 33 and wind turbines at buses 18 and 25. A mathematical problem formulation is developed to evaluate DR placement strategies, incorporating solar radiation, temperature variations, and wind speed data to ensure an optimal balance between energy supply and demand. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimization approach significantly enhances voltage stability, reduces power losses by 42.6%, and improves system reliability by minimizing EENS. The findings highlight the effectiveness of strategic DR allocation in achieving a more sustainable and cost-efficient power distribution network. This study provides valuable insights for utilities, policymakers, and system operators, offering a robust decision-making framework for optimizing DR deployment in smart grids."

The proposed antenna, with dimensions of 45 mm × 45.5 mm and fabricated on an FR4 substrate of 0.8 mm thickness, employs a coaxial probe feed to achieve optimal performance. The design demonstrates resonance at five frequencies: 0.99 GHz, 2.69 GHz, 5.87 GHz, 7.63 GHz, and 9.02 GHz, with corresponding return losses of -14.97 dB, -32.42 dB, -27.21 dB, -18.70 dB, and -25.03 dB. The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) at these frequencies is well within the acceptable range, recorded as 1.44, 1.04, 1.10, 1.30, and 1.12, respectively. The antenna exhibits impedance bandwidths of 80 MHz, 70 MHz, 90 MHz, 120 MHz, and 130 MHz across the operating bands, and achieves a maximum gain of 4.23 dBi. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations were carried out using Ansys HFSS v15 to evaluate the antenna’s performance. The fractal geometry enhances multiband performance while maintaining a compact size, making the antenna suitable for modern multiband communication systems. Detailed analysis of the return loss, VSWR, bandwidth, and gain confirms the potential of the design for integration into advanced wireless networks."

Accordingly, this study investigates DT thermal behavior to predict HST with high fidelity. During temperature-rise testing (TRT), optical fiber sensors (OFSs) are employed to assess the proposed non-uniform three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Relative to OFS measurements, the new 3D CFD-based thermal analysis exhibits a deviation of only 0.11% (0.1 °C), demonstrating excellent accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, the non-uniform 3D CFD temperature fields are validated via thermographic imaging for both the top-oil temperature (TOT) and bottom-oil temperature (BOT). The resulting discrepancies remain below 0.65%, indicating strong agreement between thermography and CFD predictions at both locations and, consequently, adequate accuracy of the proposed model. Finally, the incorporation of nanofluids lowers key thermal indices, thereby extending transformer service life."

Then, the distribution of armature magnetomotive force with and without stator flux gaps is analyzed. In addition, the equivalent winding factor is proposed to quantify the results, which reveals the reasons for torque improvement and losses reduction with the adoption of stator flux gaps. Afterwards, the electromagnetic performance of the original and proposed motors is comparatively analyzed. Finally, some experiments on the prototype FMDPM motors are carried out for validation."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral remote sensing plays an important role in agricultural monitoring, and fine-grained wheat variety classification is essential for advancing smart agriculture. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality spectral samples and the challenges associated with collecting large-scale hyperspectral data. To cope with these issues, we design a hybrid supervised-driven two-stream collaborative network (HSTNet), which consists of a semi-supervised conditional generative adversarial network for data augmentation (SCGAN) and a supervised two-stream discriminative network (STDNet) for wheat classification. In SCGAN, the generator constructs a mapping relationship between input noise and real wheat hyperspectral samples to generate fake wheat hyperspectral samples that are highly matched with the distribution of the real sample, and the discriminator with multilayer perceptions utilizes discriminative learning to identify real and fake samples. In STDNet, it collaboratively extracts the spectral, spatial and texture features of wheat hyperspectral images employing the dual-stream branch structure of 3DCNN and 2DCNN. Subsequently, it utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform and the cross-attention mechanism to refine and fuse these features to improve their capability of feature expression. Noteworthy, the individual design effectively improves the classification results of wheat varieties via collaborative optimization among modules. Besides, we built a mixed wheat hyperspectral dataset (MWHD) with 4800 samples of 20 wheat varieties. Extensive experiments on our constructed MWHD dataset demonstrate that the proposed HSTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in wheat variety classification. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bakam412/HSTNet."

    "abstract": "Existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods primarily rely on consistency learning to enhance model performance. However, most current approaches only validate the effectiveness of consistency learning under single perturbations, while introducing multiple perturbations may lead to the failure of consistency learning and degrade model performance. To address this issue and effectively leverage multiple perturbations for consistency learning, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method based on multi-perturbation consistency learning. Specifically, we design a cross-teaching framework integrating sparsely annotated 3D and 2D networks, introducing network perturbations through multidimensional architectures while combining strong and weak data augmentation techniques to achieve input perturbations. Furthermore, to address the instability issue in multi-perturbation consistency learning, we develop two complementary uncertainty-aware correction algorithm targeting labeled and unlabeled data. These designs effectively enhance the model's robustness to both labeled and unlabeled data, overcoming the instability problem in multi-perturbation consistency learning. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on four datasets(ProstateX, HPH55, ACDC, and LA). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods across all validation datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. This indicates that our approach can maintain excellent performance with limited annotated data while achieving efficient medical image segmentation.The project code will be made publicly available upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors in computed tomography (CT) images is essential for timely diagnosis, guiding therapeutic strategies, and predicting clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer. However, the small size, irregular morphology, and complex spatial context of pancreatic tumors pose significant challenges for conventional segmentation methods, often leading to misclassification or omission of tumor regions. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine dual-stage segmentation framework. In the first stage, a coarse segmentation network, built on a multi-scale backbone, extracts preliminary tumor regions by leveraging rich contextual features. These coarse predictions are refined by an interaction enhancement module that transforms initial visual cues into tumor-aware priors and spatial weights to localize and crop tumor candidates. In the second stage, a fine segmentation network equipped with a class-aware boundary-refinement loss further enhances the delineation of small tumor structures and inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on a benchmark pancreatic tumor dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance, with an average DSC of 60.24%, consistently outperforming existing baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction techniques help analysts make sense of complex, high-dimensional spatial datasets, such as multiplexed tissue imaging, satellite imagery, and astronomical observations, by projecting data attributes into a two-dimensional space. However, these techniques typically abstract away crucial spatial, positional, and morphological contexts, complicating interpretation and limiting insights. To address these limitations, we present SEAL, an interactive visual analytics system designed to bridge the gap between abstract 2D embeddings and their rich spatial imaging context. SEAL introduces a novel hybrid-embedding visualization that preserves image and morphological information while integrating critical high-dimensional feature data. By adapting set visualization methods, SEAL allows analysts to identify, visualize, and compare selections-defined manually or algorithmically-in both the embedding and original spatial views, facilitating a deeper understanding of the spatial arrangement and morphological characteristics of entities of interest. To elucidate differences between selected sets of items, SEAL employs a scalable surrogate model to calculate feature importance scores, identifying the most influential features governing the position of objects within embeddings. These importance scores are visually summarized across selections, with mathematical set operations enabling detailed comparative analyses. We demonstrate SEAL's effectiveness and versatility through three case studies: colorectal cancer tissue analysis with a pharmacologist, melanoma investigation with a cell biologist, and exploration of sky survey data with an astronomer. These studies underscore the importance of integrating image context into embedding spaces when interpreting complex imaging datasets. Implemented as a standalone tool while also integrating seamlessly with computational notebooks, SEAL provides an interactive platform for spatially informed exploration of high-dimensional datasets, significantly enhancing interpretability and insight generation."

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that shape can encode quantitative data via a mapping between value and spatial frequency (SF). However, the set-size effect when perceiving multiple SF based items remains unclear. While automatic feature extraction has been found to be less affected by set size (number of items in a group), higher-level processes for making perceptual decisions tend to require increased cognitive demand. To investigate the set-size effect on comparing integrated SF based items, we used a risk-based scenario to assess discrimination performance. Participants were asked to discriminate between pairs of maps containing multiple SF glyphs, in which each glyph represents one of four discrete levels (none, low, medium, high), forming an aggregate “risk strength” per map. The set size was also adjusted across conditions, ranging from small (3 items) to large (7 items). Discrimination sensitivity is modeled with a logistic function and response time with a mixed-effect linear model. Results show that smaller set sizes and lower overall strength enable more precise discrimination, with faster response times for larger differences between maps. Incorporating set size and overall strength into the logistic model, we found that these variables both independently and jointly influence discrimination sensitivity. We suggest these results point towards capacity-limited processes rather than purely automatic ensemble coding. Our findings highlight the importance of set size and overall signal strength when presenting multiple SF glyphs in data visualization."

    "abstract": "Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) empower domain experts, potentially without software development training, to address their software requirements themselves by raising the level of abstraction beyond code. Domain experts typically interact with an LCDP through a graphical or text-based environment, which is more intuitive to use the more specific it is to their domain and to them as users. While most of the LCDPs from major vendors support a variety of users and domains by providing more general languages that require additional customization efforts, the modeling constructs for a specific LCDP must be created manually to support new domains and users-a laborious process. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive code generation capabilities. However, domain experts often lack the skills to integrate the generated code into their organization’s software ecosystem.Combining the power of both LCDPs and LLMs, this thesis focuses on automating the building of modeling constructs of LCDPs using LLMs (“LCDP GenAIrator”). Specific LCDPs allow domain experts to approach their tasks naturally because the modeling constructs mirror their understanding of the real world, while leveraging the code generation capabilities of LLMs provides a more efficient, automated way of creating LCDPs. More precisely, this thesis investigates how multimodal LLM input, including text (natural language), documents, structured data, images (e.g., screenshots), videos, code, and language specifications, can be used to create new LCDPs and extend existing software systems with LCDPs. Multimodal input is essential because a variety of artifacts contain domain knowledge, particularly modeling constructs. While their extraction can be automated, it requires different inputs that can be provided by domain experts. Additionally, the thesis explores how to utilize and optimize LLMs to excel at the task of generating modeling constructs from multimodal input using techniques such as fine-tuning, agent orchestration, and prompting strategies.This thesis is carried out through industry-academia collaborations that allow to evaluate the “LCDP GenAIrator” using different scientific methods, from the lab to the industry partners’ sites.CCS Concepts • Software and its engineering → Domain specific languages; Visual languages; Model-driven software engineering; Abstraction, modeling and modularity; • Human-centered computing → HCI design and evaluation methods; User centered design; • Computing methodologies → Artificial intelligence"

By combining the A-star algorithm's fast, deterministic search with ACO's global optimization, the method uses A-star to quickly generate an initial path and enhance it with a local adjustment strategy, solving common ACO issues like slow convergence and local optima. A simulation based on real factory layouts compares A-star, traditional ACO, and the improved algorithm in path length, convergence, and stability. Results show A-star is fast but less adaptable, while ACO offers global search but is unstable early on. The improved method balances both, delivering shorter, more stable routes with fewer iterations. This approach provides an effective solution for fire evacuation and other emergency route planning."

In a within-subjects experiment of eight matched chatbot app microtasks with nine developers and 144 runs, the framework plus agent condition completed tasks 56 percent faster with an agent-to-framework ratio of 2.29 and 95 percent confidence interval from 1.40 to 3.63, and at 43 percent lower cost with an agent-to-framework ratio of 1.76 and 95 percent confidence interval from 1.12 to 2.58 compared to the agent-only condition. Reliability signals improved with fewer human interventions and comparable error rates, token efficiency, and latency. A separate 50-user study reported a System Usability Scale mean of 70.6 with a 95 percent confidence interval from 68.6 to 72.6, exceeding the common benchmark of 68. These results support repositoryfirst, agent-assisted development as a practical approach to democratize chatbot creation while maintaining portability and code ownership."

This study proposes a hybrid framework integrating a genetic algorithm (GA) to dynamically identify high-priority fire boundaries based on spread velocity and an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to generate collision-free suppression paths. The model focuses on minimizing extinguishing time and total fire spread area, tested under scenarios simulating wind-driven spread and irregular boundary expansion. Results demonstrate the hybrid strategy ensures timely intervention and effective containment of fire spread. Future work will involve simulating complex forest fire scenarios, taking into account factors such as terrain slope, heterogeneous vegetation flammability, and dynamic wind patterns. This will aid in studying more realistic phenomena of forest fire spread."

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a critical non-invasive technique for cardiovascular health monitoring through wearable devices, yet the physiological mechanisms underlying PPG signal formation are not completely understood. This affects the development of accurate diagnostic tools and personalized health monitoring systems. To overcome it, analysis of how cardiac output and other physiological factors are reflected in PPG, especially at the wrist, is required, and end-to-end PPG simulation methods have been developed for this purpose. However, these methods have limitations in either accuracy or computational efficiency. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating wristbased PPG signals by integrating radial artery hemodynamics with optical light transport modeling through skin. In our approach, first, cardiac parameters are used to generate the cardiac output. This is passed into an upper left limb artery simulation, which produces arterial pressure, flow, and crosssectional area variation at each location. These waveforms at the radial artery are used by a novel, computationally efficient light transport simulation through the skin to generate the PPG signal. The morphological features of the PPG waveform generated by our method are closer to those of real PPG data compared to simulations that utilize a deterministic method as an alternative to light transport simulation. Furthermore, our light transport simulation method is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo method used for more accurate simulations. Therefore, our approach provides a balance of both computational efficiency and accuracy in wrist PPG simulation, aiding the development of personalized cardiovascular monitoring systems."

In this paper, a reduced-order qd0 model of the induction machine is proposed to explicitly account for magnetic saturation and its adverse effects on the air-gap flux, which emerge as higher-order distortions. Capturing the saturation and harmonic effects leads to higher-order models and thus increased computational complexity. However, neglecting dynamic states of harmonics that play a minor role in the general system’s behavior and replacing them with algebraic solutions results in a lower system order. The eigenvalue analysis shows that the full-order and low-order models share almost the same dynamics. This confirms that the proposed low-order model may offer similar transient performance but with higher computational efficiency. The model’s performance is evaluated against the full-order model and experimental measurements, verifying its accuracy and computational efficiency."

They require magnet structures that are easy to process and efficient cooling structures to ensure reliable motor operation. This paper takes an 85kW radial PMSM as an example. Based on the characteristics of PM and finite element analysis, a two-dimensional model of a motor using rectangular magnets is established to study the impact of the rectangular magnet structure on the motor's electromagnetic performance and losses. The research results indicate that motors with rectangular PM structures can reduce magnet losses without significantly affecting torque density, while also reducing the risk of magnet demagnetization within a certain range."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), their charging demands pose significant challenges to the security and stability of power grids. The spatiotemporal randomness of EV charging behavior tends to exacerbate the peak-valley load difference of the grid, degrade power quality, and increase network losses. However, as distributed energy storage units, EVs can utilize vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to mitigate fluctuations in renewable energy, provide frequency regulation services, and participate in grid load shifting, thereby promoting the coordinated development of energy and transportation systems. Existing path planning methods often rely on simplistic integration of static road and grid information, failing to reflect dynamic coupling characteristics and multiagent interactions, which limits their real-time applicability. To address this, this paper proposes a dynamic path planning method that holistically considers users ’ travel time, energy consumption, and economic costs. By designing dynamic road network and electricity price models, the method dynamically responds to real-time road network conditions and grid load variations, updating path weight parameters through the fusion of road and grid information. This approach not only meets users ’ charging/discharging needs but also achieves grid load balancing and road network traffic optimization, maximizing overall system benefits. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method alleviates grid peak-valley differences, balances traffic flow, enhances user benefits, and optimizes comprehensive system interests."

Tensor decomposition can effectively reduce redundant parameters and FLOPs in DNNs, facilitating deployment on edge devices. In the context of Tensor Ring (TR) decomposition, two challenges arise: (1) redundancy in input and output channels during the TR decomposition process; (2) significant oscillations in the gradient magnitudes of remaining channels during iterative training. Joint compression based on tensor ring decomposition and structured pruning (TR-SP) method is proposed to address these issues. The proposed approach consists of three steps: (1) structured pruning, (2) rank selection, and (3) fine-tuning to recover accumulated accuracy loss. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a given network, TR-SP achieves the best performance in terms of Top-1 accuracy and parameter efficiency across various compression levels. Furthermore, TR-VB achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 public benchmark."

    "abstract": "Skin cancer ranks among the most common health conditions across the world, and the decision to treat it effectively hinges on its early diagnosis. The research presented herein introduces a hybrid deep learning approach that complements YOLOv5's real-time lesion localization ability with the robust post-classification ability of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model was tested and trained on the ISIC2018 and HAM10000 datasets. Both datasets include a mixture of skin lesions including melanoma, nevus, basal cell carcinoma, and other types. We made sure we balanced the split dataset of 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing to reflect the real-world distribution of classes. This is particularly important to avoid overfitting, especially for rare lesion types like melanoma. Preprocessing steps such as contrast enhancement and data augmentation were applied to improve feature representation and model generalization. A multi-stage pipeline including preprocessing, contrast augmentation, and data augmentation is utilized for enhancing the quality of features and generalization of models. Experimental results show that the YOLOv5-SVM model has a 96.8% classification accuracy and surpasses baseline models for F1-score (0.93), AUC (0.981), and IoU (0.86). Comparative analysis, ablation tests, and visual feature projections validate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in reducing false positives and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The suggested model also preserves real-time inference speeds, hence appropriate for deployment in tele dermatology and mobile healthcare applications. These findings highlight the potential of integrating object detection with scalable machine learning to develop efficient and accurate AIpowered dermatological tools. These results highlight the potential of the proposed YOLOv5-SVM system as a scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate solution for AI-based dermatological screening."

Subsequently, to address the noise issue in infrared images, we design an adaptive median filtering algorithm to effectively remove salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edge details. Furthermore, we propose the Adaptive Convolutional Context Attention (ACCA) module, which dynamically adjusts convolutional-kernel sizes, enhancing the model's ability to perceive features across different image regions. To further improve feature representational capacity, we design the Adaptive Feature Enhancement (AFE) module, which strengthens the model's ability to capture and integrate semantic information across channels. Experimental results demonstrate that SAIMNet improves object detection accuracy."

The proposed approach decomposes PV power into two key factors: installed capacity and decoupled PV output per installed capacity. For installed capacity forecasting, an improved linear rolling prediction method is developed, which incorporates historical capacity data and monthly characteristics for correction. The decoupled PV output, which represents the normalized power generation efficiency, is predicted by the XGBoost regression model that leverages meteorological data (e.g., surface solar radiation) and temporal features. By decoupling the capacity influence from the actual power generation, our method effectively handles the impact of dynamic capacity changes on long-term forecasts. Experimental validation using real-world data from Shandong province in China demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for monthly and 10-day predictions.

While the elasticity of public cloud providers benefits this transition—opaque, provider-specific pricing renders economically viable deployment, especially across federated clouds, difficult.OBJECTIVES: This work aims to enable cost-aware deployment of Digital Twins across federated cloud providers by modeling DTs as multi-layered architectures and optimizing service selection per layer to minimize operational expenses.METHODS: We introduce Twin2Clouds, a cost-driven DT engineering framework that (1) organizes DT functionality into five cloud-oriented layers to help engineers map twin components to suitable cloud services, (2) offers cloud-agnostic cost and pricing primitives that capture heterogeneous pricing schemes across providers and services, and (3) integrates these elements in a cost-aware deployment model that predicts cloud costs and prescribes a reproducible deployment plan selecting the lowest-cost services for each layer.RESULTS: A quantitative evaluation of three real-world scenarios, ranging from a large smart building (30,000 devices) to a smart home (100 devices), demonstrates that Twin2Clouds consistently outperforms single-provider baselines. Depending on scale and workload, monthly costs decrease by an average of 24.6% and up to 79% compared with single-cloud alternatives.CONCLUSION: Twin2Clouds equips DT engineers with a practical, vendor-neutral method for navigating today’s complex cloud landscape and for realizing scalable, sustainable, and economically viable Digital Twins."

Vision-based methods, particularly pose estimation combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promising accuracy but raise privacy concerns due to the use of sensitive visual data. This paper proposes a privacy-aware fall detection system that leverages pose-based skeletal data and integrates Differential Privacy (DP) into LSTM training, providing formal guarantees of data privacy. We evaluate our approach using a publicly available dataset, comparing standard LSTM models against those trained with DP at various privacy levels (privacy budgets, ε). Our results indicate that incorporating DP introduces a measurable performance trade-off: higher privacy protection (smaller ε) leads to reductions in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly affecting the detection of minority-class events (falls). Nevertheless, moderate privacy settings ($\\varepsilon \\approx 2$ to 5) still achieve acceptable performance (approximately $85-87 \\%$ accuracy), balancing privacy and practical utility effectively. This work underscores the importance of carefully selecting privacy budgets to maintain model efficacy while ensuring rigorous data protection, offering a robust approach suitable for sensitive environments such as elderly care facilities."

Despite its benefits, the initial creation and maintenance of Infrastructure as Code templates remains tedious. Manual template creation may lead to security vulnerabilities and inconsistencies between design and implementation. Furthermore, cloud architecture complexity makes it harder to prevent configuration drift, where infrastructure deviates from its intended use case. Moreover, a lack of automation in template creation hinders rapid deployment and leads to inefficiencies. This paper presents an automated system for converting Amazon Web Service cloud architecture diagrams into CloudFormation templates. Using deep learning models and image processing techniques accompanied by a deterministic rule set, the system detects Amazon Web Services’ service components and their relationships from the input architecture diagram. The system detects the various icons (depicting services) present in the diagram with an accuracy of 98.40%. Simultaneously, a group detection module recognises various logical and physical boundaries such as Virtual Private Clouds or Security groups that define network and security segmentation. Rule-based suggestions are made on the extracted information to infer services that are not explicitly illustrated. Finally, the CloudFormation template is generated based on the aggregated output. Through this pipeline, the solution streamlines the automatic creation of CloudFormation templates with a latency under 15 seconds, minimising errors and development effort."

    "abstract": "Detecting small-scale defects on wind turbine components remains a major challenge due to issues such as motion blur, surface glare, occlusion, and complex backgrounds during drone-based inspections. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight detection framework enhanced by a novel Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation (MSFA) module, which effectively captures and fuses local detail and global context through deformable convolutions and an adaptive gated mechanism. This enables the network to focus on subtle defects even in noisy environments. We also introduce the Wind Turbine Visible Dataset (WTVD), containing 4,467 high-resolution images with pixel-level annotations across seven fault types. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and speed, achieving an mAP@0.5 of 91.57% and supporting real-time inference at over 30 FPS on edge devices, making it highly suitable for efficient, drone-based wind turbine inspection in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "This research focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system for Thai restaurant reviews, aiming to classify opinions into a five-star rating scale. The primary goal is to provide a tool that reflects customer satisfaction trends, offering valuable insights for business owners to enhance their services. We collected 7,200 reviews from Wongnai and Google Maps. After cleaning the data, a subset of reviews with lengths between 80 and 510 characters was used, with 6,000 entries for training and 1,200 for testing. The model we fine-tuned, WangchanBERTa, is a pre-trained Thai language model based on the BERT architecture. The fine-tuned WangchanBERTa model demonstrated a significant improvement in performance for star rating classification, achieving an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{F} 1-score$</tex> of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 0. 4 5 \\%$</tex>, a substantial increase over the 65.28% F1-score of the baseline model. Although some minor misclassifications occurred between adjacent ratings, the overall performance was deemed satisfactory. Furthermore, the developed sentiment analysis system was integrated into a web interface, which allows users to input review text and receive real-time sentiment summaries. This system not only assists consumers in making more informed decisions when selecting restaurants but also helps restaurant owners understand and respond to customer feedback."

This paper proposes a comprehensive strategy to IoT safety, taking into account potential threats and effective defense mechanisms. We begin by reviewing existing methodologies for IoT security and highlighting their limitations. Subsequently, we present our methodology, detailed through this paper, which involves searching for an optimal Stacked Ensemble (SE) model that can effectively detect attacks. Our strategy combines several Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. To gauge the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted an experimental study using an IoT dataset. Our findings indicate that the best-performing models are Random Forest (RF) and an SE model combining RF, AdaBoost and a Deep Neural Network. These two algorithms exhibit very similar performances and both exceed 98.27 % and 98.26 % accuracy respectively in detecting 15 classes. However, in contrast to RF, the SE model achieves flawless Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for 14 classes and 0.99 for the last one. Our study underscores the need for a comprehensive contribution to IoT security and identifies the most promising techniques for fortifying these systems against potential cyber threats. In this article, we provide great insights into the challenges and solutions related to the protection of IoT devices within industrial settings. Organizations can use our proposed approach and the information gained from our study to enhance the security and privacy of their IoT systems."

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and a significant proportion of patients do not respond to standard pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) provides a non-invasive neuromodulatory therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD); however, the absence of reliable biomarkers limits its precision. In this study, resting-state EEG was recorded prior to treatment from 80 MDD patients undergoing a 20-session rTMS protocol. Spectral features across canonical frequency bands were extracted from 19 scalp electrodes, and a regularized feature selection technique identified a single high-frequency component at electrode F4 as the primary discriminator between responders (R) and non-responders (NR). This feature was normalized relative to an empirically derived reference cohort of optimal R to create a differential index. Combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers under leave-one-out cross-validation, this index separated R from NR with 100% accuracy. These findings indicate that a succinct, interpretable spectral marker can predict individual rTMS outcomes and may inform personalized neuromodulation strategies in future studies."

The parameters of the inverter in actual systems are often unknown, and traditional state space methods cannot be used. Meanwhile, the frequency impedance method requires the system to be divided into active and passive sides for analysis. For complex systems containing multiple inverters, the frequency impedance method is also difficult to apply. The frequency domain modal method can be used to analyze the interactions between inverters in complex systems. This paper uses the impedance measurement method to obtain the impedance model of the vehicle and photovoltaic power generation, and analyzes and studies the impact of photovoltaic power generation system access on the low-frequency oscillation stability of traction power supply system based on frequency domain modal analysis method. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are validated through Matlab/Simulink time-domain simulation model."

The framework aims at addressing the gap between the “ideal” of individualized learning support and the “reality” of teachers' heavy workloads by exploring (1) whether AI feedback can be evaluated on par with teacher feedback and (2) how feedback content interacts with the quality of student reflections across distinct achievement levels. A feedback support system was developed utilizing multiple large language models in an agentic workflow according to Hattie and Timperley's feedback model. The system was implemented in a sixth-grade mathematics unit on ratios (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n=14$</tex>, eight lessons), with teacher and AI feedback alternating. Quantitative analyses displayed no significant difference in perceived usefulness ratings between teacher and AI feedback across achievement levels. Content analysis exhibited that teacher feedback highlighted task and self-regulation levels, while AI feedback depended more on self-level comments, with variation across achievement groups. Case studies affirmed that alignment between feedback content and learners' implicit needs determined perceived usefulness. Overall, the findings propose that AI can complement teachers by delivering immediate, affective feedback, thereby freeing teachers to focus on context-sensitive, high-expertise instructional support."

To address this challenge, we propose TransEF, a lightweight local feature extraction network that achieves synergistic optimization of efficiency and performance through two key innovations. Firstly, we design self-enhanced feature descriptors by integrating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with convolutions to construct parameter-efficient descriptor enhancement modules. Secondly, we develop a structure-aware detection branch through an independent feature detection network. By leveraging knowledge distillation guided by an ALIKE teacher network, this branch forces the model to focus on underlying geometric structures. Experimental results on MegaDepth and HPatches datasets demonstrate that compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves better balance between runtime efficiency and network performance in downstream tasks, making it more suitable for practical applications."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution networks and the enhanced interaction between source, grid, and load, the requirements for voltage stability are becoming more stringent. Traditional static voltage stability indicators, due to their high nonlinearity, cannot effectively guide the optimal operation of distribution networks. In response, this paper proposes a linear static voltage stability index, which offers the potential for voltage security optimization in distribution networks. First, analogous to the traditional L-index, and based on reasonable assumptions combined with the impedance characteristics of distribution networks, a linear voltage static stability indicator is proposed based on solvable power flow equations. Second, the Sobol' method is employed to quantitatively analyze the impact of input variable uncertainties and correlations on the voltage stability indicator through global sensitivity analysis. Then, based on the sensitivity analysis results, an optimization operation model for distribution networks is established, balancing economic efficiency and stability, with constraints linearized using second-order cone optimal power flow. Finally, the proposed stability indicator and optimization operation model are tested on the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating the accuracy of the indicator and the superiority of the optimization operation model."

While both platforms enable rich user experiences, they also introduce significant security risks through architectural and implementation flaws. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of vulnerabilities in Telegram MiniApps and WeChat Mini Programs, drawing from documented exploits and empirical testing. For WeChat, prior studies reveal widespread issues including sensitive data leakage, weak permission enforcement, and cross MiniApp request forgery, affecting millions of deployed apps. For Telegram, we identify unproxied frontend–backend communication leaking IPs and server endpoints, insecure HTTP defaults in the Bot API enabling man in the middle attacks, and inadequate auditing of TON blockchain smart contracts. We further analyze adversarial MiniApps exploiting WebView sandbox weaknesses for malware delivery, cryptomining, and cryptocurrency phishing. Building on these findings, we propose a comprehensive mitigation framework tailored to Telegram but informed by lessons from WeChat’s vulnerabilities. Our approach includes mandatory HTTPS, Telegram-hosted proxying, sandbox isolation, automated malicious activity detection, and AI-assisted code auditing. The results highlight the urgent need for platform level reforms across superApp ecosystems to align rapid feature growth with strong user privacy and security guarantees."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) arrays are often subject to the negative impacts of partial shading conditions (PSCs), such as non-uniform irradiance caused by surrounding objects, cloud shadows, and dust accumulation. Such PSCs can significantly reduce power generation efficiency, potentially damage PV cells, and lead to complex multi-peak characteristics in P-V curves. To address the multi-peak power output issues induced by PSCs, this study explores dynamic array reconfiguration as a solution. Specifically, a 10×10 PV array model is constructed, and a novel Gene-pairing Configuration Strategy (GCS)-based dynamic reconfiguration algorithm is proposed for real-time optimization under shaded conditions. The core objective is to mitigate PSC-induced power losses and enhance total power output. Simulations demonstrate that under a specific short-wide partial shading pattern, the proposed GCS reconfiguration optimization achieves over 30% improvement in maximum power point output compared to the pre-reconfiguration baseline."

    "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), celebrated for its high-power generation efficiency and environmentally friendly attributes, holds significant promise in the domain of green energy. However, the high-temperature operating conditions of SOFC frequently trigger various heat management-related faults, which severely compromise system reliability and operational lifespan. Consequently, developing high-performance fault diagnosis methods enables the timely detection and localization of faults, allowing for the implementation of measures to prevent further escalation and potential damage. In this study, a phased hybrid fault diagnosis approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed, where LSTM extracts temporal features while SVM performs precise classification based on the extracted features. Utilizing data from three representative thermal fault types within SOFC systems, the method is evaluated under both single-fault and multi-fault diagnostic scenarios. Moreover, five conventional data-driven methods are introduced for comparison to validate the diagnostic performance of the LSTM-SVM model in terms of Hit Rate (HR), False Alarm Rate (FAR), Correct Rate (CR) and response time. The experimental results demonstrate that in single-fault diagnostic scenarios, the LSTM-SVM model exhibits optimal performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.99%, with a false alarm rate as low as 0.06% and a notably fast response time. In multi-fault diagnostic tasks, the LSTM-SVM model achieves the highest precision of 99.71% and the best hit rate of 99.59%, while also demonstrating faster response speeds. These advantages establish LSTM-SVM as the most effective method. This study provides a valuable foundation for selecting and optimizing fault diagnosis strategies for thermal management challenges in SOFC systems, offering meaningful insights and guidance for future research efforts in the field."

This paper addresses this issue by analyzing the power imbalance mechanism under receiving-end faults. It proposes a coordinated control strategy combining energy dissipation devices with voltage reduction at the sending end to address excess power and suppress transient overvoltage. This strategy leverages the temporary energy storage characteristics of converter stations to increase their equivalent capacitive storage capacity, thereby temporarily suppressing DC-side overvoltage, and utilizes the power dissipation capability of energy dissipation devices to dissipate overall excess power. Finally, simulations were conducted using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

The simulation integrates laminar flow and heat transfer physics to evaluate critical parameters including velocity distribution, volume flow rate, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and temperature profile. Results show stable laminar flow with a low Reynolds number (Re = 0.175), minimal secondary flow effects (Dean number = 0.107), and consistent volume flow rates around 262 μL/hr within 35 minutes. Thermal analysis indicates effective heat transfer with uniform temperature distribution along the channel.

This study aims to investigate cybersecurity risks in e-healthcare applications and rank them. Therefore, it will identify which risks are most critical and, accordingly, which risks should be combated first.

A 3D device structure of 4H - SiC MOSFET was simulated, and I-V characteristics was used to extract critical electrical parameters, including threshold voltage (Vth), on-current (Ion), off-current (Ioff), subthreshold swing (SS), and Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). The influence of physical dimensions such as epilayer thickness (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{W}_{\\text{Drift}}$</tex>), and gate length (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{L}_{G}$</tex>) on electrical characteristics was investigated by varying device parameters for power applications, focusing on ON-state behavior, such as on-resistance. It was found that Ron had a significant effect below <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> of width, while for gate lengths from 1.2 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.8 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>, Ron remained almost constant. Furthermore, stress testing was conducted to evaluate degradation effects in terms of breakdown voltage and electric field under variations in doping concentrations, temperature, and biasing voltage. It was found that temperature had very little impact on breakdown voltage, but increasing the doping concentration by 2 times resulted in 3 times decrease in breakdown voltage."

The quest for converters that delivers high gain with the reliable performance in this domain is no history. Majorly there are three DC-DC converters classified based on their gain with respect to input as boost converter, buck converter and buck-boost converter. This work focuses on novel DC-DC high gain boost converter topology which can boost input voltage with a gain of about 11.76 at 70% duty cycle. The circuit is simulated in MATLAB and performance is analysed considering duty cycle, settling time and peak voltage as the parameters for verification of novelty. The comparative analysis is carried out with the existing standard DC-DC boost converter topology. While boosting the input DC voltage of 150 V by the gain of 5 for a 2000W system, the duty cycle required was reduced by 63.29%, settling time being reduced by 50%, peak voltage being reduced by 49.8% than that of the standard DC-DC boost converter topology, which ultimately results in reduction of component stress."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of dual prescribed performance (convergence speed and accuracy) control for underactuated surface vessels (USVs) under multi-time scales, this paper proposes a new simplified tracking control approach founded on singular perturbation. To resolve the underactuation constraint, a dynamic feedback coordinate transformation is employed. This transformation maps the velocity composite variable and the position variable into the fast and slow subsystems respectively, thus establishing a singular perturbation model suitable for USVs. Then, the singular perturbation system is decoupled in time scale to obtain non-coupled fast and slow subsystems. For the fast subsystem, the corresponding control law is designed using a predefined-time convergence method. To govern tracking error dynamics in the slow subsystem, a performance function enforces both transient and steady-state performance. Further fortifying robustness, a nonlinear disturbance observer provides continuous estimation and real-time compensation for unknown environmental disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy was verified through Lyapunov stability analysis."

Different solutions are part of healthcare digital transformation through mobile implementations. In this paper, presented a lead electrode-based and cross-platform-supported ECG device called CorSeg, which is suitable for monitoring heart activities in home and outdoor environments. Additional functionalities are body temperature measurement and movement detection for removing motion artifacts and calculating heartbeat rate. An ESP32-PICO-D4 integrated microcontroller board called ESP32 PICO KIT D4 has been used to obtain and process the ECG data. A cross-platform supported software has been developed with a.NET MAUI framework to store and visualise the ECG data. To send and receive data between the CorSeg device and the cross-platform software, Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Bluetooth communication protocols have been used. The activation of the protocols depends on the device where the software is installed. For mobile devices, the CorSeg ECG device uses Bluetooth communication, while it uses USB for desktop devices. The CorSeg device has been tested with the FLUKE ECG simulator in a laboratory environment, where the simulation and real-life test on volunteers suggest that the device's performance is good enough to monitor heart rhythm. The device is fabricated with a 3D-printed box so that the user can put the box in their pocket during walking."

Owing to the unstructured and perturbable properties of water, the task of water-surface take-off remains profoundly challenging. Furthermore, at the microscale, there persists a notable scarcity of a rapid, stable, and lightweight attitude adjustment mechanism. So it is challenging for robots to achieve water-surface sliding and take-off dual-mode motion. To handle this problem, this paper optimizes the shape of the support feet to significantly reduce the drag force during takeoff, and designs a rapid, stable, and lightweight attitude adjustment mechanism based on a linear servo with a self-locking function. On this basis, a flapping-wing robot capable of continuous water-surface sliding and take-off is designed. Experiment shows that continuous water-surface sliding and takeoff motion is achieved, with a motion mode switching time of 0.03 s."

The model is built on a U-Net structure and enhanced with two key components: a channel-sequence attention (CSAtt) module and a Densely Connected Multi-Dilated Convolution (D3) block. The CSAtt module enables the model to emphasize the most informative regions of the speech signal by capturing both channel-wise (frequency) and time-based patterns in the spectrogram. The D3 block is used as the central layer in U-Net, which utilizes dilated convolutions with dense connections to comprehend the broader context while preserving detail. The model takes spectrograms as input and is trained using Huber loss, making it more robust to noise and better at preserving sound quality. Tests show that this combination of attention and dilation techniques produces significantly better quality and more comprehensible speech, making the model suitable for real-world applications, such as phone calls, hearing aids, and voice assistants."

    "abstract": "In recent years, countries have increasingly promoted the deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) to leverage their environmental and economic benefits. These incentives often take the form of power purchase agreements (PPAs), which guarantee fixed electricity prices regardless of market fluctuations. While PPAs provide steady profits for RES owners and encourage investment, they also introduce challenges within power systems. A key issue arising from these agreements is that RES owners may submit excessively low or even negative bids to secure market commitments, thereby activating PPA benefits and feeding electricity into the grid. As a result, regions with high shares of RESs may experience market clearing at negative prices. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency mining loads (CMLs) have become a significant energy consumer, accounting for nearly 1% of global electricity consumption, a share that is expected to grow. While the increasing presence of CMLs poses challenges for power grids, they can also offer valuable services, particularly in terms of demand-side flexibility. This paper proposes CMLs as highly flexible loads to counteract negative pricing. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, case studies were conducted, indicating that CMLs can mitigate the instances of negative prices without causing price spikes. Furthermore, the results showed that integrating CMLs into the electricity grid can reduce the curtailment of the RESs."

    "abstract": "This work introduces a constant bandwidth oversampling PLL (CBW-OSPLL) that eliminates the noise degradation and stability limitations of conventional oversampling phase-locked loops (PLLs) caused by sampling gain fluctuations. The proposed CBW-OSPLL utilizes a constant-gain oversampler composed of double-edge capacitive charging and discharging PIs (DE-CCDPIs) and sampling single-edge capacitive charging and discharging PIs (SSE-CCDPIs) with embedded reference sampling functionality. The DE-CCDPIs provide eight clocks with phases uniformly distributed within a reference cycle, which are further evenly split into 16 phases through SSE-CCDPIs. The intrinsic sampling functionality embedded in the proposed SSE-CCDPI ensures a constant sampling across all sampling locations, enabling improved noise and stability. To further improve the linearity of the DE-CCDPIs and SSE-CCDPIs, direct-gating transition and voltage clamping techniques are proposed, collectively reducing the differential nonlinearity of the DE-CCDPIs and SSE-CCDPIs to 0.001 LSB.

To address this issue, this article proposes a zero-shot time-series prediction (ZSTT) model based on the transformer framework, referred to as ZSTT. It enables multisource time-series prediction without requiring pretraining on the target dataset. Approximate Bayesian inference is first considered to increase the generalization ability of the model. A learnable pattern module, which employs a Gumbel-distribution-based dynamic masking mechanism, is then introduced to optimize joint training across multisource datasets. Finally, a real degradation test of the hydraulic actuator is conducted to assess the performance of ZSTT. Its validation through comprehensive experiments is also conducted on benchmark datasets. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods is conducted, demonstrating the performance of ZSTT in terms of higher accuracy and robustness of prediction. Furthermore, ablation studies were performed to validate the contribution of each individual module. The case study demonstrates the high performance of ZSTT in multisensor data prediction and performance degradation prediction."

Quantization is a widely adopted compression technique, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1)</i> Existing quantization methods are unable to select suitable models for deployment according to the resource limitations of mobile devices; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2)</i> Mixed-precision quantization-based methods utilize reinforcement learning and element-level quantization, which incurs substantial computational and memory costs on mobile devices. To this end, we propose Resource Awareness-Based Salience-Weighted Mixed-Precision Quantization (RAS-MQ). Specifically, RAS-MQ constructs a memory and latency computation incorporating model parameters and device constraints, then RAS-MQ employs integer linear programming for optimal per-layer bit-width allocation. Weight matrices are partitioned into groups with bit-widths assigned based on average saliency ranking. Furthermore, RAS-MQ applies training-free quantization range clipping to salient weights, which can improve representational capacity while reducing quantization error. Experiments on five zero-shot inference datasets, for the 2-bit quantization of LLaMA2-13B, RAS-MQ outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline (SqueezeLLM) by 0.85% in accuracy and reduces weight memory consumption from 24.5 GB to 4.1 GB, achieving a 5.98× compression ratio."

    "abstract": "The task of hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD) is to identify the subtle category changes of land surfaces by utilizing the rich spectral information of bi-temporal hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent advanced deep learning methods have improved the performance of HSI-CD. However, HSIs have the mixed-pixel phenomenon, which affects the ability of HSI-CD models to discriminate land-cover changes. In this paper, a frequency domain Mamba (FreMamba) model is proposed to precisely capture the details of the spatial and spectral changes in bi-temporal HSIs, with consideration of the abovementioned problem. The proposed FreMamba model utilizes the capability of the Mamba model to adaptively filter the critical change information in long-range feature sequences. This is combined with frequency domain information to enhance the low-frequency global information and high-frequency spatial detail representation, based on a dual-branch network structure. A low-frequency spectral-guided attention (LSGA) module is proposed for the low-frequency Mamba branch, where it is embedded within the Mamba block via residual connections. Global low-frequency features are aggregated by the LSGA module with noise suppression, while the spectral change discriminability of ground objects is adaptively enhanced via the subsequent Mamba blocks. In the high-frequency Mamba branch, a high-frequency spatial geometric enhancement (HSGE) module is proposed that preserves edge details by spatial frequency domain decomposition to extract high-frequency geometric features. Experiments on three public HSI-CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed FreMamba model can accurately capture detailed change information and can outperform the existing state-of-the-art HSI-CD methods."

While geometry based methods dominate the field, learning based approaches are still in their infancy despite promising progress. Current deep learning based VIO methods usually fuse visual images and inertial measurements directly, neglecting intra modal frequency heterogeneity, cross modal dependencies, and temporal continuity in state estimation. We propose a State Space Visual-Inertial Odometry (SS-VIO) framework that fuses modalities through a Mamba-based time-frequency modeling module. The first is a time frequency interaction module with Mamba that captures joint temporal and frequency representations and performs adaptive selection. The second is a cross modal fusion module that integrates inertial cues into visual features through learned weighting. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that SS-VIO outperforms state of the art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Additional tests on RealSense D435i quadruped robot data confirm the generalization ability of the framework across different platforms."

    "abstract": "Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces-from cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it frequently, leveraging learned experience in tandem with vision and non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms. We investigate the role of contact force sensing for training robots to gently reach into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities are (1) “eye-in-hand” vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a measure of object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40 unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without force information."

    "abstract": "Multi-carrier modulation has been widely employed in medium-voltage modular multilevel converters (MMCs) due to its implementation simplicity. Nevertheless, typical modulations usually ignore the effects of common-mode voltage (CMV), while recent low CMV modulations (e.g., pulse-edge reconstruction and edge-triggered pulse sequential connection) can lead to increased switching frequency or reduced DC-link voltage utilization ratio, thereby limiting their applicability in medium- and high-power scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two phase-compensated (PC) multi-carrier modulations for MMC, namely PC carrier phase-shifted (CPS) sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) and PC carrier disposition (CD) SPWM. First, a waveform-decomposition-based universal CMV model for MMC is developed by accessing the mechanisms and characteristics of CMV fluctuations under typical CPS SPWM and CD SPWM. Following that, the proposed modulations are analytically derived, realizing effective CMV suppression without increasing the switching frequency or reducing the DC-link voltage utilization ratio. Moreover, the electrical performance of the proposed modulations for MMC is systematically evaluated using seven key performance indicators and compared with that of existing modulations. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modulations are validated through simulation and experimental results."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently risen to prominence for a variety of inverse-imaging problems. Many such models use what is commonly known as conditional diffusion which effectively samples from the distribution of the desired image conditioned on some known side information, often a degraded or lower-resolution version of the target image. However, an alternative paradigm has recently emerged in the form of constrained diffusion in which explicit constraints between the target image and the side information are iteratively incorporated into the diffusion reconstruction during inference. While prior literature has considered conditional and constrained diffusion to effectively be mutually exclusive, a diffusion algorithm is proposed to combine the two within the widely-used denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) framework. The resulting approach—constrained conditional denoising diffusion—inputs both the target and side information into the diffusion network during both training and inference similar to conditional diffusion but also applies explicit constraints during inference like constrained diffusion. The proposed approach is evaluated for the task of fusing a hyperspectral image, possessing high spectral resolution, with a multispectral image, having high spatial resolution, to yield an image with high resolution both spatially and spectrally, an inverse-imaging problem called hyperspectral-multispectral fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, not only can constrained and conditional diffusion operate complementarily and achieve performance superior to either used alone, but also that the proposed constrained conditional denoising diffusion outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for hyperspectral-multispectral fusion."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), particularly within the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm), is a sophisticated imaging technique for numerous medical applications, enabling reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of internal tumors from surface fluorescence signals. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning methods in FMT reconstruction tasks, however, their performance heavily relies on large-scale, diverse labeled datasets. The existing researches primarily focused on datasets with static tumor characteristics, including fixed tumor numbers, locations, and sizes, which shows an insufficient pattern diversity, limiting neural networks' generalization ability for complex real-world scenarios beyond the training dataset. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the similarity between Monte Carlo photon simulation and sampling process of diffusion model, to propose a diffusion model-based data augmentation strategy. Further, we introduce a novel NIR-II-specific guidance mechanism to enhance sample fidelity and diversity by incorporating NIR-II spectral optical properties. Quantitative analysis validated that high-quality NIR-II fluorescence signal samples are synthesized, where the proposed NIR-II guidance achieved a 56.7% reduction in Fréchet Inception Distance(FID) and a 21.5% improvement in Inception Score (IS), covering a broad spectrum of patterns. Since the synthetic samples are unlabeled which cannot be used for neural network training, these samples are integrated with the original dataset as augmented samples and train FMT neural networks by semi-supervised learning. By combining pattern-diversifying strengths of diffusion models with semi-supervised learning, the proposed strategy maximizes the utility of limited datasets. Both simulative and in vivo experiments confirmed that data augmentation significantly enhances the network's reconstruction performance in precisely localizing tumor sources and reconstructing complex morphologies.

In this article, we propose a novel vision-assisted method for precise human chest wall localization in microwave vital sign detection. This approach identifies the chest wall region of interest (ROI) using human pose key points detection, aligns visual and microwave domains through a coordinate transformation framework, and employs a robust Chest Wall Peak Extraction (CWPE) algorithm to suppress non-human targets clutter and detect heatmap peaks within ROIs. Experimental results show the method can accurately locate human targets in various scenarios, including single-person, cluttered multi-person, and challenging case with complex spatial arrangement. The max measured respiratory rate and heart rate achieve errors of only 0.48 bpm and 1.64 bpm respectively compared to chest strap references, demonstrating the method’s effectiveness and robustness in positioning and measurement. This integration of vision and microwave sensing advances non-contact monitoring in complex real-world environments."

    "abstract": "Foot–ground contact detection is essential for analyzing human motion and supporting balance control in humanoid and wearable robotic systems. This paper proposes a physics-informed framework that integrates motion simulation with graph-based learning to achieve robust contact detection across complex terrains. The method combines physics-based motion synthesis with a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN), which models human joints as nodes and bones as edges, capturing both spatial coordination and temporal evolution. To generate diverse and physically consistent training data, we simulate locomotion scenarios using the PyBullet physics engine with Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP). These simulations span flat, inclined, and composite terrains. Real-world motion data are collected using a commercial inertial motion capture suit equipped with 17 IMUs (sampling at 96 Hz) from 13 volunteers performing walking, running, and complex movements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TGCN achieves accurate frame-wise contact detection across various terrains and motion types, outperforming sequential baselines such as LSTM. With 1.72 million parameters and a memory below 100 MB, the TGCN model enables real-time inference with less than 10 ms inference time. This scalable and physics-grounded approach provides strong potential for deployment in real-time motion analysis, gait evaluation, and humanoid locomotion control."

However, it grapples with environmental challenges, especially from static (e.g., furniture) and dynamic objects (e.g., people walking), as well as how demographic factors such as BMI and sensor quantity affect accuracy. This paper addresses these gaps through a focused experiment on gait-based participant identification. Our methods and techniques encompass variance exploration for movement detection, Channel Power Distribution (CPD) analysis, and polynomial fitting to determine walking direction.We present a novel model for gait recognition, using a hybrid architecture that combines convolutional layers, LSTM blocks with residual connections, and multi-head self-attention mechanisms. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our gait identification system using two datasets: MultiEnvironment and HWDD. Both consist of data from 10 volunteers. We achieved 96.1% and 96.66% accuracy for MultiEnvironment and HWDD, respectively. To benchmark our system, we selected four state-of-the-art pre-trained models: Transformer, LSTM, CNN and SVM. Finally, we benchmark our technique against a dataset that we collected for 25 individuals, demonstrating an accuracy better than other state-of-the-art techniques of 97.9%."

This study presents an automated SQCB system that integrates these steps into a single digital workflow. Focusing on automation rather than web interfaces, the system eliminates redundant activities and minimizes manual work. A case study at a motorcycle manufacturer demonstrates a 31.23% reduction in processing time (from 134.5 to 92.5 minutes per incident) while significantly reducing administrative burden. The system decreases total manhours from 6.7 to 4.6 hours per day across six staff. The approach enhances real-time visibility, enforces standardized workflows, and optimizes workforce utilization. The results highlight how process automation supports digital lean manufacturing and strengthens efficiency in supplier quality management."

However, their performance is restricted by uncertain factors, affecting the accuracy and reliability of the system. This paper investigates the trajectory tracking problem of robotic manipulators subject to internal uncertainties and external disturbances, and proposes a novel global fixed-time sliding mode control strategy. First, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is adopted to address the adverse effects of model uncertainties and external disturbances in the manipulators system. To enhance the system's robustness, a new non-singular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) surface is designed, which effectively overcomes the singularity problem. Based on the estimated disturbances from the observer, a fixed-time non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (FTNFTSMC) is developed to ensure that the trajectory tracking error converges to zero rapidly within a fixed time. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted on a two-link robotic manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A comparison with other existing sliding mode controllers confirms its superior control performance."

We propose a cross-modal attention framework for non-invasive asthma classification from dual retinal modalities, colour fundus photographs (CFP; Type 1: posterior pole view; Type 2: optic nerve head view) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements, where systemic changes manifest in retinal structure and vasculature. Fundus images are encoded by a CNN backbone followed by multi-head self-attention (MHSA); OCT metrics are embedded by a lightweight feed-forward encoder; cross-modal attention (CMA) then fuses the two streams to capture intermodal dependencies. Trained and evaluated on a novel dual-modality dataset curated at UNSW Centre for Eye Health (CFEH), the model achieves an AUC of 0.97 and offers improved interpretability via attention-weight visualisations. These results support retinal biomarkers as a scalable pathway for early asthma detection and open a window to population-level oculomic screening for other systemic diseases (e.g., neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases), highlighting the promise of CMA for ocular imaging."

Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a non-invasive way to monitor muscle activation, but its analysis is affected by noise and the complexity of extracting discriminative features for robust classification. This work proposes a complete pipeline for sEMG feature extraction and lower-limb movement classification using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) implemented on an FPGA-based System-on-Chip (SoC). sEMG signals from eight muscles were processed to distinguish sitting, standing up, remaining still, and walking. Four computationally efficient time-domain features-Average Power (AP), Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Integrated sEMG (IEMG), and Simple Squared Integration (SSI)-were extracted and fed into the network. The system achieved 92.5% accuracy and sub-millisecond inference latency, demonstrating a practical trade-off between accuracy, latency, and hardware efficiency. Unlike most state-of-the-art approaches that rely on offline GPU processing, our design enables real-time operation on a compact, low-power SoC platform. These results confirm the feasibility of deploying machine learning models for portable rehabilitation devices, paving the way for intelligent, resource-efficient human-machine interfaces in clinical environments."

    "abstract": "In this article, a robust current sensorless control approach via second-order sliding mode (SOSM) is proposed for disturbed DC–DC buck converters. In converter systems, conventional current sensors lack reliable measurements and the demands for high-precision sensors lead to increased circuit costs. In such scenarios, current states are often reconstructed by state observers to ensure tracking performance. However, general state observers are incapable of independently estimating the internal system states when coupled with mismatched terms and disturbances. It indicates that the observer design cannot be separated from the controller. To this end, this paper aims to develop a SOSM synthesis controller based on the \"non-separation principle\". The current sensorless finite-time SOSM control scheme demonstrates attractive properties in faster convergent speed, higher control accuracy, and strong robustness against multiple disturbances. The rigorous global finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is given based on Lyapunov design approach. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control approach."

These models are employed as fixed feature extractors, and the concatenated representations are subsequently used to train and evaluate classical classifiers, including Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among these approaches, the SVM achieved the most balanced performance, which was further improved through hyperparameter optimization. Experiments conducted on the public RIM-ONE DL dataset demonstrated that the optimized SVM attained an accuracy of 0.957, an F1-score of 0.938, and an AUC-ROC of 0.978. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating transformer-based and CNN-based deep representations with conventional machine learning models, offering a practical and resource-efficient framework for automated glaucoma classification."

The methodology involved (1) spatial segmentation of a test track via GPS to label five maneuver types—curve with banking, curve without banking, straight line, roundabout, and slalom; (2) training classical (Random Forest, KNN, MLP) and sequential (RNN, LSTM) models; and (3) comparative performance evaluation. Among all tested algorithms, the bidirectional LSTM achieved the highest average F1-score of 95.9%, outperforming the best classical model (MLP) by more than 1.5 percentage points. The classification of roundabout maneuvers reached an F1-score of 95.5%, while slalom was the most challenging with 94.8%.

    "abstract": "Software Architecture Descriptions (SADs) are indispensable for navigating the complexity of modern software systems. They enable high-level reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate communication among diverse stakeholders. Yet in practice, SADs are frequently missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system’s actual implementation. As a result, developers are forced to derive architectural insights directly from source code—a time-intensive task that increases mental effort, slows onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of architectural clarity over a system’s lifetime. To address these challenges, we propose an automated generation of SADs from source code by combining reverse engineering (RE) techniques with Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filters architecturally significant elements—core components—via prompt-guided LLM analysis, and generates state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on code logic. This dual-view representation offers a scalable and maintainable alternative to manual architectural documentation. This approach, demonstrated with C++ examples, showcases the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) find abstract component diagram, lowering the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability."

    "abstract": "With the development and wide application of new energy technology, the complexity and uncertainty of the load on the power side of the power system have increased, which has brought great challenges to the power dispatching. In view of the difficulty and low accuracy of short-term load forecasting, this paper proposes a short-term load forecasting method based on BP network model. By analyzing the historical load data, the multi-dimensional input feature set is constructed, and the dynamic relationship model between load and influencing factors is established by using the adaptive learning ability and nonlinear mapping characteristics of BP network. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional time series method and support vector machine model, the proposed BP network model reduces the mean square error (MSE) and average absolute percentage error (MAPE) by about 15% and 12%, respectively, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the method in complex load fluctuation scenarios, and provides reliable technical support for the refined dispatching of power grid. Specifically, in high proportion wind and photovoltaic integration scenarios, this model exhibits stronger adaptability to load fluctuations caused by intermittent new energy sources, effectively assisting dispatchers in developing rolling scheduling plans and reducing wind and solar curtailment rates."

To address these problems, a deep learning neural network based fretting fatigue life prediction method is proposed, taking into account cracks, wear and their interactions, which is called RADNN. The experimental results show the 92% of the prediction results of the RA-DNN given by this work are distributed within the $1.5 \\times$ limit band, and all the prediction results are within the $2 \\times$ limit band, which meets the engineering requirements and surpasses previous works. It is demonstrated that the proposed network RA-DNN can serve as an effective option to realize aero engine fretting fatigue life prediction."

To overcome the limitations of existing distributed consensus algorithms, a novel hierarchical control strategy is proposed. Conventional methods suffer from slow convergence speed, particularly as the number of ESUs increases or under sparse network topologies, which severely compromises control accuracy and system stability. To this end, the proposed strategy employs a dual-layer control architecture. The lower layer utilizes conventional droop control to achieve autonomous, communication-less load sharing, thereby ensuring fundamental system robustness and plug-and-play capability. The upper layer innovatively introduces a predefined-time consensus algorithm. Through the synergistic design of a time-varying gain function and an acceleration factor, this layer significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of current and SOC balancing among the ESUs. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical coordinated control method are validated through simulations in Matlab/Simulink."

While ANNs are extensively applied in tasks such as image processing, classification, semantic segmentation, localization, and image generation, they also offer potential for simulating psychological and cognitive processes. In this research, we examine whether convolutional neural networks (CNNs), commonly used in image processing tasks, can mimic the visual recall mechanism of the brain. A deep CNN was trained to associate a series of input images with a specific output image, referred to as the “memory image.” After training, we fed the network new input images and observed the generated outputs. In repeated trials, the CNN consistently produced images that were visually similar to the last memory image. These results suggest that CNNs may offer a viable model for exploring how the brain recalls and reconstructs recent visual memories. Consequently, the artificial neural networks have the potential to simulate psychological behaviors caused by the brain."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for their reliability and safety. Conventional methods rely on mean regression models, which fail to capture variability and quantify uncertainty. While some methods express uncertainty when predicting RUL, they have not been effectively leveraged to improve prediction accuracy and enhance model robustness. To meet this gap, this paper proposes a two-stage model combining convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), multi-head attention mechanisms (MHAM), and deep neural networks (DNN) for integrating uncertainty information. Firstly, the health indicator (HI) representing capacity degradation is extracted. HI and capacity are then fed into the 1st-DNN to produce the mean and uncertainty of capacity. Next, these outputs, along with HI, are processed by CNN and GRU to extract shape and time-dependent features, respectively. The extracted features capture the complex dependencies between the three by MHAM, while focusing on the diversity of input sequence from different perspectives, forming a multivariate feature representation. Finally, the obtained multivariate feature representation is input into the 2nd-DNN to obtain the RUL prediction results, including the prediction mean and uncertainty. The model’s feasibility is validated on NASA and Oxford battery datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that it not only outperforms traditional models, but also significantly enhances prediction reliability."

This simplification retains the essential grid-forming characteristics while streamlining the controller design process. Consensus-based distributed secondary controllers are implemented in both the frequency–active power and voltage–reactive power loops, allowing each inverter to share local state information via a sparse communication network and collaboratively correct voltage and frequency deviations in real time. To validate the proposed strategy, a simulation model comprising four parallel inverters is constructed in MATLAB/Simulink and benchmarked against conventional AHO-VOC control. The results indicate notable enhancements in dynamic performance and power-sharing precision, supporting the practical deployment of coordinated virtual oscillator–based microgrid control."

The paper proposes a GHI long-term prediction method tailored for insurance applications, combining STL-EMD-VMD multi-dimensional decomposition with SARIMA+LSTM-Attention. This is in response to the challenges of single models struggling to account for multiple temporal patterns and prone to overfitting. Firstly, STL is utilised to decompose GHI data from photovoltaic power plants into seasonal, trend, and residual components. Secondly, based on the Hurst index, frequency, and sample entropy of each component, the trend component undergoes improved EMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) decomposition, while the residual component undergoes VMD (Variable Mode Decomposition) decomposition based on whale optimization, achieving a secondary fine decomposition. Finally, the SARIMA+LSTM-Attention model is applied to jointly forecast different sub-components, and the results are automatically optimized and integrated using multiple metrics such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{\\mathrm{2}}$</tex>.

Traditional static and symbolic analysis tools cannot handle intricate logic and are limited in adaptability and explainability.

This paper introduces a collaborative LLM-based model that enhances detection robustness through semantic similarity-based few-shot prompting and multi-LLM reasoning. Our model integrates diverse LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) as worker nodes, along with an aggregator model to resolve disagreements via justification analysis and final prediction consolidation.

    "abstract": "Deadbeat Predictive Current Control (DPCC) is widely used in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) due to its excellent tracking performance and low computational burden. However, its performance is sensitive to the accuracy of motor parameters, and parameter mismatches can significantly degrade control effectiveness. To enhance the parameter robustness of DPCC, an improved DPCC method based on disturbance-observer-based parameter identification is proposed. First, the impact of parameter mismatch on the control performance of conventional DPCC is analyzed. Then, an Extended State Observer (ESO) is introduced to compensate for the one-step prediction delay, enabling simultaneous prediction of the current and observation of the total disturbance. Based on the disturbance estimated by the ESO, a method is developed to compute the inductance and flux linkage errors, which are then used to update the model parameters of both the DPCC and ESO in real time. The proposed method requires minimal control parameter tuning and can accommodate a wide range of parameters mismatches. Finally, a simulation platform is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparative simulations with conventional DPCC and ESO-based DPCC demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses the adverse effects of parameter mismatches and significantly improves the robustness of motor control."

After excluding replies, retweets, and non-English posts, 2,555 tweets were organized into 12 categories and examined for recurring themes with the assistance of ChatGPT. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed both control factors and specific post types that significantly affect engagement, while word cloud visualizations offered further insights into categories with positive effects. Findings suggest that Toyota could refine its content strategies, as posts emphasizing brand resonance, functionality, emotional appeal, and experiential aspects were associated with higher engagement. The research supports the relevance of applying content categorization models to an automotive brand's Twitter activity. Nevertheless, its scope is limited to a single company within one industry and one platform, highlighting the need for future studies to consider multiple brands and alternative social media channels. Moreover, little prior work has evaluated the influence of emerging post categories on engagement, and this framework has not been extensively tested on Twitter."

We are the first to utilize dimensionality reduction to speed up the private computation of complex filtering rules in privacy-preserving FL. Additionally, we analyze the accuracy loss of vector-wise filtering in low-dimensional space and introduce an adaptive tuning strategy to minimize the impact of malicious models that bypass filtering on the global model. We implement ABBR with state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust aggregation rules and evaluate it on public datasets, showing that it runs significantly faster, has minimal communication overhead, and maintains nearly the same Byzantine-resilience as the baselines."

The city’s uncontrolled waste dumping and improper disposal methods, particularly at poorly managed sites such as the Htain-Bin Waste Dump, pose severe health and environmental challenges. These sites release significant amounts of greenhouse gases and leachate, exacerbating the situation. This research explores Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies as a viable solution to address both waste management and energy shortages in Myanmar. The study evaluates various WTE conversion options, including incineration, biogas recovery, and others, to assess their potential in reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal. By examining the WTE policies and practices of other developing countries, the research identifies strategies that could be effectively adapted to Myanmar’s context. The findings highlight that, with proper implementation, WTE projects can significantly reduce reliance on landfills, decrease carbon emissions, and mitigate excessive methane production, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to the challenges posed by waste management in Yangon."

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of critical parameters in power grids, such as electricity load, price, and renewable energy production, plays a pivotal role in implementing demand response strategies and maintaining grid stability within smart grid systems. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on an encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism to simultaneously predict these essential parameters. To enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns and long-term dependencies in time series data, we incorporate a preprocessing step using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which transforms the data into the frequency domain. This transformation aids in reducing noise and extracting latent patterns, thereby improving the model's predictive performance. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world electricity consumption datasets from multiple regions, including Austria, Italy, Sweden, and the UK. It is compared against several state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, such as LSTM, CNN-LSTM, LSTM-Attention, and a basic encoder-decoder structure. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy in most cases, particularly for short- to medium-term predictions (12 to 48 hours ahead). Additionally, visualizations of the predictions reveal that the proposed method closely follows the actual trends, confirming its effectiveness in capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies. This study contributes to the field by introducing a flexible and robust framework that integrates attention mechanisms and frequency-domain preprocessing to improve time series forecasting in the electricity domain. The proposed approach not only enhances prediction accuracy but also provides valuable insights into the underlying patterns of electricity consumption and production, making it a promising tool for smart grid applications.

Firstly, based on the actual grid topology, load characteristics, and solar resource data of the region, a probabilistic power flow calculation model considering temporal characteristics and randomness is constructed. This model evaluates key technical constraints such as node voltage violations and line overloads caused by PV integration under different penetration rates, thereby determining the physical load-bearing limit of the grid. Furthermore, the study introduces the price signals of the electricity spot market and constructs a “investment-operation” bi-level optimization model: the upper level aims to maximize the net income of PV and energy storage system investors for capacity planning, while the lower level simulates spot market clearing to determine real-time electricity prices and dispatch schemes."

Following initial image preprocessing and segmentation via a U-Net model, vertebrae are detected and localized using an enhanced YOLOv12 object detection framework. YOLOv12 has high accuracy, stable convergence, and a faster inference compared to the prior YOLOv10 version. LKS severity is then assessed through a rule-based strategy using Cobb angle measurements derived from the detected vertebrae, enabling objective anatomical characterization across different regions of the vertebral column. For compressions, statistical and morphological features are extracted and classified using a suite of machine learning models, with performance optimized by feature selection and class balancing techniques. The proposed system achieves robust detection and disease classification across both normal and pathological regions, showing reliable performance even in anatomically challenging cases. Designed for integration into industrial aquaculture workflows, the pipeline enables highthroughput, automated screening of large fish populations to support timely, data-driven health management at scale. This integrated approach enhances the scalability and accuracy of disease monitoring in aquaculture, and thus fish welfare and farm productivity."

An adaptive Maximum Rate of Impedance Angle Change (MRIAC) is developed to handle fast swings, high-loading conditions, and asymmetrical faults, such as those occurring during single-pole tripping (SPT). This approach enhances relay performance without requiring extensive dynamic stability studies, making it ideal for heavily loaded transmission lines. Simulation results demonstrate superior accuracy and dependability in various system conditions, with faster and more reliable fault detection during power swings.

Subsequently, the Q statistic is established using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), enabling state discrimination of CTs based on this metric. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate CT error identification and localization, proving to be an effective approach for online CT error detection."

    "abstract": "With the deepening of marine resource development and scientific research, the importance of underwater sensing and monitoring technology has become more and more prominent. By virtue of its non-contact characteristics and strong penetration ability, sonar imaging is widely used in the fields of target identification and terrain mapping. However, the complexity of the underwater environment and noise interference pose a serious challenge to the accurate detection and identification of targets in sonar images. To address this challenge, a novel object detection framework for underwater sonar images, called ASC-USID, is proposed in this paper, which firstly introduces a Laplace Pyramid Detail Enhancement Module, which can amplify high-frequency details by multi-scale decomposition of the sonar images, and effectively suppresses noise and enhances the key target regions by combining with a gating mechanism. Further, an axial spatial coordinate feature extraction network is designed, which utilizes axial compression as well as self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies, and generates spatial coordinate attention maps to enhance position-sensitive information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of target localization and classification. Extensive experiments on the UATD dataset show that the proposed ASC-USID framework significantly outperforms baseline methods and other mainstream object detection models in terms of detection accuracy."

The system features real-time monitoring of temperature, gas emissions (methane and air quality), and pH levels, along with automated environmental controls to maintain optimal composting conditions. An actuator assists in mixing the compost, while a heater maintains the temperature using an energy-efficient battery. The sensor data is transmitted to a mobile Blynk dashboard via ESP8266, enabling remote monitoring and user alerts. We proposed development of a fully automated smart composting system that integrates automated pH adjustment through acid/alkaline dosing, and a linear regression-based machine learning model that predicts the maturity stage of compost. The system was tested using five categories of food waste—fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, and bread—demonstrating stable operation and accurate predictions. The system shows that a combined approach significantly optimizes decomposition conditions and reduces the composting cycle to under 12 hours, a reduction by a third in comparison to commercial composting machine."

    "abstract": "The classical Internet faces increasing limitations as data generation and device interconnectivity expand at unprecedented rates. In recent years, this has highlighted the need for communication frameworks that surpass classical limitations. The quantum Internet (QI), composed of multiple layers of quantum communication networks (QCNs), holds promise for remarkable capabilities in secure transmission, distributed quantum computing, and quantum-enhanced sensing. Accurate and scalable modeling of QCNs is essential for designing, analyzing, and optimizing QI protocols under realistic physical conditions. To model such open quantum systems under Markovian noise, the Lindblad master equation is widely used, but its modeling complexity grows exponentially with the system size. In this work, we introduce a learned approach that utilizes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, which embeds the Lindblad formalism directly into the neural network's loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simulating the entanglement fidelity decay of a two-qubit Bell state under energy damping and phase decoherence noise, which is a relevant scenario for entanglement-based QI protocols. Preliminary numerical results show that the PINN-based solver aligns with conventional partial differential equation techniques while offering improved scalability. These findings suggest that PINNs could serve as an efficient approach for accelerating the analysis of future quantum networking solutions. Finally, we conclude by outlining key future directions for scaling the framework to support QCN-level optimization."

First, the estimated state is considered as the center of a zonotope, which is then scaled to form a particle zonotope that encloses the particles and characterizes their distribution region. Furthermore, the adaptive weighting parameters are determined based on the proportion of particles covered by the zonotope and a decay factor over iterations. Two zonotopes are then fused through adaptive weighting to generate a new particle-feasible domain. This domain enhances both the robustness and estimation accuracy while maintaining particle diversity. Subsequently, a vector scaling method is used to determine whether each particle lies within the feasible domain, and particles outside the domain are discarded and replaced with newly generated ones to maintain a constant population size. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified through a state-of-charge estimation case for lithium-ion batteries."

This spectral asymmetry enabled the implementation of a combined wavelength-based and intensity-based interrogation scheme. By separating the influence of each parameter in the spectral response, it was possible to measure the refractive index independently, without interference from temperature variations. A refractive index sensor with a minimum detectable change of δ = 1.2 × 10⁻⁴ RIU was demonstrated. In addition to introducing a novel structure that leverages Fano resonance, the sensor was also applied as an evaporation rate sensor. The results demonstrate its potential for a wide range of applications, serving as a foundation for the development of future optical sensing technologies."

    "abstract": "The widespread proliferation of fake news on the Internet, especially in multi-modal formats, poses a substantial threat to society. Most deep learning-based approaches for fake news detection yield accurate predictions but lack explainability. Existing models focusing on explainability visualize key components from results or generate surface causes via Large Language Models. However, they can hardly provide the deep rationale behind the fabrication of fake news, which is indispensable for misinformation mitigation. Thus, we approach explainability from a different perspective, focusing on explaining how fake news is fabricated, which we term deceptive patterns, at its very source. First, four types of deceptive patterns are pre-established, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Image Manipulation</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Cross-modal Inconsistency</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Image Repurposing</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Others</i>. Based on this, we propose GE-NSLM, a General Explainable Neuro-Symbolic Latent Model that integrates the power of Large Vision Language Models, which not only provides accurate judgments but also offers insights on deceptive patterns. Specifically, each deceptive pattern is represented as a binary learnable latent variable, obtained through amortized variational inference and weak supervision guided by logical rules. Experiments show GE-NSLM achieves competitive performance. More importantly, it provides interpretable insights into the underlying reasons why specific news items are fake.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to generate textual descriptions of changes between bitemporal images. However, accurately describing fine-grained changes while capturing inter-scale relationships as well as distinguishing real changes from spurious changes (e.g., illumination, seasonal variations) are still major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we propose DualFocus-CapNet, a novel model tailored for RSICC. DualFocus-CapNet employs a dual-stream architecture, where each stream is dedicated to processing a distinct pair of bitemporal features. Crucially, we introduce a Scale-wise Progressive Convolution (ScalePro Conv) that employs a progressive scale-specific approach to decompose remote sensing features into pixel-level variations, regional continuities, and linear structures. Unlike conventional parallel multi-scale processing methods, ScalePro Conv adopts a serial progressive structure to establish inter-scale relationships, thereby avoiding the fragmentation of feature information. Then, the Bi-Directional Difference Guided Transformer (BDiGTrans) is proposed to eliminate interference from spurious changes by dynamically masking invariant regions and extracting bidirectional differential features. Furthermore, the Cross-Temporal Adaptive Fusion Module (CTAF) is introduced to dynamically balance bitemporal features using learnable gating to enhance change discrimination and robust caption generation. Comprehensive experiments on the benchmark datasets LEVIR-CC and WHU-CDC show that our DualFocus-CapNet surpasses state-of-the-art change captioning methods in various evaluation metrics."

First, the topography aware representation introduces topography distribution to drive abstraction of higher-order landform representations, resulting in discriminative topography awareness. Second, the captured topography-aware features are further processed using the elevation attentive aggregation to stress the significance of elevation information in GF. Finally, the global feature homogeneity is introduced to analyze the long-range interactions and contextual information in the network. The performance of the TAGF-Net is evaluated on a GF benchmark, which was collected in California, USA and encompassed varied topographic settings and forest ecosystems. Compared with representative traditional and deep-learning methods, the TAGF-Net attains cutting-edge performance with total error of 1.16%.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents face fundamental challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, particularly when sparse or dense rewards bias learning toward sub–optimal behaviors. Biological systems, notably human toddlers, naturally navigate this balance through developmental transitions from free exploration to goal-directed behavior. Inspired by this progression, we propose the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D) reward transition for goal-oriented RL tasks. Our approach transitions from sparse rewards encouraging broad exploration to dense rewards guiding efficient exploitation, while preserving optimal policies via potential-based reward shaping throughout. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation and egocentric 3D navigation tasks, we demonstrate that S2D transitions significantly enhance sample efficiency, and generalization compared to static reward schemes and intrinsic motivation baselines. Using a novel Cross-Density Visualizer, we reveal that S2D transitions smooth the policy loss landscape, resulting in wider minima associated with improved generalization. Furthermore, reinterpreting Tolman’s maze experiments in modern RL contexts, we show that early sparse-reward exploration establishes robust initial parameters analogous to cognitive maps, facilitating stable learning under subsequent dense rewards. Our findings bridge developmental psychology and machine learning, offering a principled framework for designing adaptive reward structures in complex RL environments."

    "abstract": "Existing zero-shot deepfake detection methods are often constrained to specific scenarios and struggle in diverse, complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a universal zero-shot deepfake detection method. This method models the common forgery traces across different domains as domain-invariant features and introduces a novel domain-invariant meta-learning strategy. This strategy embeds the mechanism of domain-invariant learning into a meta-learning framework, enabling the model not only to extract specific domain-invariant features from certain domains, but also to leverage the meta-learning mechanism of fast adaptation to new domains. As a result, the model is capable of effectively capturing the intrinsic domain-invariant characteristics of deepfake images, thereby achieving universal zero-shot deepfake detection. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest average detection AUC (86.96%) across 28 unseen datasets, representing an improvement of 8.02% over the second-best method (78.94%). Moreover, it is the only method that is effective in all four zero-shot scenarios, which strongly validates its superior zero-shot detection performance and universality.

UniDA primarily faces two challenges: domain alignment under label shift and identifying unknown class samples in the target domain. We propose a cross-domain class context optimization method for UniDA to address these two challenges, leveraging a contrastive language-image pre-training model containing learnable prompts. First, we develop a domain context-guided feature augmentation technique, which augments source domain features based on textual features related to the target domain style, improving the consistency of feature distributions between the source domain and target domain. Subsequently, we learn a set of class contexts suitable for the target domain using the augmented source domain features. Furthermore, to improve the ability of the class context to filter unknown class samples, we propose a local known-unknown entropy optimization strategy, which effectively reduces the interference from class-irrelevant semantic information in the images, thereby mitigating erroneous class matching under label shift. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results compared to advanced UniDA approaches. Additionally, experimental results show that our entropy optimization strategy can serve as a general optimization component for prompt tuning, enhancing the generalization performance of existing methods when applied to downstream tasks with label shift."

However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>Depth, a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map, utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual boosting mechanism is designed to iteratively refine both depth and surface normal predictions. Experimental results on synthetic Mars datasets with depth annotations show that M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>Depth achieves a 16% improvement in depth estimation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in depth estimation. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong applicability in real-world Martian scenarios, offering a promising solution for future Mars exploration missions."

    "abstract": "This work presents a solution based on a deep neural network for detecting and classifying faults in photovoltaic modules using thermographic infrared images comparing the performance of different machine learning techniques. Three scenarios were evaluated, those being the identification of the presence of faults, whether the faults are permanent or not and finally a classification of the type of fault. The core of the proposed methodology utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. Initially, a relatively deep CNN is developed as a standalone system for fault detection and classification. Subsequently, the feature extraction layers from the proposed CNN are employed to convert dataset images into more straightforward vectors of attributes, which are then used to train other more general classifiers. This approach aims to create easier and promising learning conditions for any classifier, especially those that are not intrinsically devised to operate directly with digital images as input data. The results emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated models and encourage further research investments on the proposed feature extraction approach."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes PPS-DMIA (Push and Pull Search with Directed Mating and Infeasible Archive), a novel evolutionary approach for constrained multi-objective optimization, which commonly arises in real-world optimization problems characterized by multiple conflicting objectives and practical constraints. Push and Pull Search (PPS) provides a promising framework by improving objective values while ignoring constraints in the push phase and searching for feasible solutions in the pull phase. PPS-DM (PPS with Directed Mating) accelerates the pull phase by directed mating, which guides the search by mating infeasible solutions in the search population with feasible non-dominated solutions in the archive. However, its effectiveness is limited by the infrequent occurrence of directed mating, the current solution generation method, and the strategy for selecting guiding solutions. To overcome these limitations, the proposed PPS-DMIA introduces four key mechanisms: (i) it comprehensively updates the archive with all solutions generated during the search, thereby increasing opportunities for directed mating; (ii) it introduces an additional archive of infeasible solutions, which facilitates directed mating when feasible solutions are scarce; (iii) it uses the direct difference vector between a focal solution and a selected archive solution to generate a new solution; and (iv) it selects guiding solutions from the archive by considering the search direction of the focal solution, enhancing the directional bias of directed mating. Experimental results on the LIR-CMOP benchmark suite show that the proposed PPS-DMIA enhances directed mating effectiveness and achieves superior search performance, outperforming PPS-DM and other state-of-the-art algorithms."

Meanwhile, the group delay (GD) ripple and flat-NGD bandwidth (BW) can be set according to design requirements to further constraints on the values of circuit parameters. For verification, an NGD circuit is designed, fabricated, and measured at the center frequency of 1.0 GHz. From the measured results, the NGD time of −0.5 ns at the center frequency is obtained with insertion loss (IL) of 16.3 dB. The flat-NGD BW reaches 43.8%, 21.9%, and 11.2% with 12% GD ripple, and the variation of IL is less than 1.8 dB. The proposed NGD circuit can be potentially applied to multiconstellation GNSS and multiband 5G/4G MIMO systems, enabling significant advantages in multiband transceiver systems and NGD application integration."

Consequently, high-performance embedded platforms are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the use of Linux is highly attractive to industry due to its extensive ecosystem (platform support, AI libraries, etc.) and its opensource development model. However, Linux was not designed to comply with strict safety standards, which complicates its use in safety-critical systems. Previous works have studied the nondeterminism of Linux kernel system calls regarding their execution paths and execution times, and proposed alternative approaches to justify its use in such systems. In this work, we continue those efforts with two main contributions. First, we compare a regular Linux kernel with the kernel patched with the PREEMPT_RT real-time patch, and show how the patch reduces the variability of system calls, both in terms of timings and execution paths. Then, we propose an additional layer of assurance in the form of a trie-based monitor implemented in hardware, which ensures that the variability measured and estimated during testing holds when the system is fielded, both for execution paths and execution times. We implement a software prototype of the monitor to demonstrate its feasibility and discuss our plan to migrate it to hardware."

By constructing a multi-branch feature extraction network, the automatic decoupling and fusion of time-domain features from multiple signals are achieved. Firstly, an 8-channel parallel convolutional architecture is designed to process features from different sensors, employing large 64×1 kernels to enhance local feature extraction. Secondly, a feature fusion module is developed using depthwise separable convolutions, where 1×1 convolutions facilitate cross-channel information interaction. Finally, batch normalization is incorporated to effectively mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average diagnostic accuracy of 97.66% on a gearbox dataset covering eight composite fault types.

    "abstract": "Space tracking and control resource scheduling is a highly complex, dynamically constrained combinatorial optimization problem. To address the challenges posed by the large number of satellites, diverse types, and high likelihood of tracking and control time window conflicts, this paper proposes an improved Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm incorporating a dual-branch gated neural network architecture to address the resource scheduling problem in large satellite constellations. First, a mathematical model of the task is constructed, considering multiple constraints, including the task time window, priority, release time, and resource demands. Second, by introducing a shared feature extraction layer and a task scoring branch, the priority and temporal urgency of each task are modeled separately. A gating mechanism is employed to fuse the scores and improve the strategy’s capability in identifying critical tasks. This paper selects three representative algorithms that employ distinct solution strategies-the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the standard DQN algorithm -to compare against the proposed improved DQN algorithm. A unified simulation environment and a consistent evaluation metric system are established to ensure fair comparison. The experimental results indicate that the improved DQN algorithm achieves a higher scheduling success rate, improved resource utilization, and demonstrates strong stability and robustness under complex task scenarios. In Scenario 1, the scheduling success rate, high-priority task completion rate, resource utilization rate, and average scheduling lead time are $95.00 \\%, 92.86 \\%, 28.10 \\%$, and 9.47. In Scenario 2, these metrics are $77.50 \\%, 80.65 \\%, 29.31 \\%$, and 8.87.

    "abstract": "Defining an academic assessment calendar, particularly for midterm and final exam periods, is a complex challenge faced by many universities, including the Universidad de la República (UDELAR) in Uruguay. The large number of courses and the diversity of student trajectories, with many students simultaneously taking courses from different years of their degree programs, lead to conflicting interests when scheduling exams. Additionally, there are various logistical constraints, such as limited classroom availability, and academic restrictions, such as the requirement to avoid scheduling exams for courses in the same semester on the same day. Moreover, faculty members generally prefer the evaluation period to be as short as possible, as regular classes are suspended during this time.In this work, we present a strategy that employs evolutionary algorithms to generate examination timetables, aiming to maximize student satisfaction while minimizing the duration of the evaluation period. We formulate the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem and explore different approaches by varying the criteria used for initializing the population. We evaluate our approach on a real-world instance from the School of Engineering, and the numerical results suggest that this is a promising approach to this problem."

This research proposes a real-time UAV path-planning system based on a Hierarchical Recursive Multiagent Genetic Algorithm (HR-MAGA). Unlike traditional methods that struggle with adaptability in dynamic 3D environments, our system employs localized waypoint updates to reduce the computational cost of full-path recalculations. A multi-objective fitness function guides the optimization process by balancing safety, energy efficiency, altitude smoothness, turbulence resistance, and travel time. Additionally, the system integrates a decoupled real-time collision avoidance module for immediate response to sudden threats. While obstacle detection is abstracted in this study, the framework is designed to be easily integrated with real-time sensing technologies such as LiDAR for dynamic obstacle awareness. Experimental evaluations show a 20–30% improvement in path efficiency and a 40% increase in convergence speed compared to conventional genetic algorithms, highlighting the system’s adaptability and robustness in disaster response scenarios."

    "abstract": "Mental health conditions are increasingly affecting populations across the world. While audio, video, and image-based emotion recognition methods are widely used, they are susceptible to intentional emotion masking by individuals. In contrast, Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition offers a more reliable and direct insight into a person’s emotional state, making it valuable for applications in human-computer interaction, medical diagnostics, military systems, and mental health monitoring. However, existing EEG-based models often struggle with limited accuracy and generalizability. This paper introduces a Multi-stage Bilateral-feature, Fusion-based deep learning framework, called MBF-Net, that integrates parallel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) streams through a multi-stage feature fusion strategy. The model is further enhanced by attention mechanisms, including Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance on four benchmark EEG datasets, namely SWELL, WESAD, Brainwave EEG, and SEED, achieving classification accuracies of 99.99%, 99.99%, 99.00%, and 99.99%, respectively. These results underscore the proposed model’s robustness, interpretability, and real-world applicability in affective computing and brain-computer interface domains.

Multi-view modelling enables customised view tailored to different stakeholders, thereby separating concerns and fostering collaboration. Because multi-level modelling approaches have more complex semantics, and views represent subsets of a model - conflicts may not be obvious or explicitly visible to end users. There is no conflict management framework currently applicable for multi-level and multi-view modelling approach. In this paper, we propose a conflict management framework which can detect and resolve overlapping changes and semantic conflicts. We present algorithms that support the framework and the conflict resolution, which leverages priority-based and rule-based strategies to restore consistency across the model and views."

To enhance the global search capability and accelerate convergence of the algorithm, we employed the CEAO algorithm, which is an optimization approach that utilizes the CVX toolbox to optimize the random initialization of the Enzyme Action Optimization (EAO) algorithm. This method aims to identify the optimal current amplitude distribution for achieving the desired radiation pattern with minimal sidelobe levels. To validate its efficacy, the paper presents simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the CEAO algorithm effectively enhances the performance of linear antenna arrays by mitigating the broadening of the first-null beamwidth (FNBW) and simultaneously reducing the peak side lobe level (SLL). This approach serves as a valuable reference for addressing similar model optimization challenges in the field of antenna array design."

A dataset of 30 typical operating conditions during the rapid load increase phase is constructed from operational data and finite element simulations. Baseline condition relationships are analyzed to correct prediction biases. A physics-informed neural network incorporates continuous temperature distributions from adjacent simulations, integrating physical and temperature loss functions for model optimization.

    "abstract": "In the current context of rapidly increasing computing power, new data centres are subject to strict requirements that at least 80% of their energy must come from green sources. It is therefore urgent to optimise the internal energy supply structure of data centres to meet load demands while further achieving energy conservation and carbon reduction.To address this, this paper proposes an integrated wind-solar-hydrogen hydrogen-electric coupling system based on electrohydrogen-cold synergy. By incorporating hydrogen internal combustion engine waste heat recovery cooling technology and considering the energy consumption of the cooling system, the architecture for renewable energy hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, and zero-carbon cooling is optimised. Ultimately, the capacity configuration of the hydrogen internal combustion engine waste heat cooling system in the data centre is optimised. The scheme employs a PSO optimisation algorithm to jointly optimise the power of the electrolyser, hydrogen storage capacity, and the output of the hydrogen internal combustion engine within a 72-dimensional solution space. Finally, simulations were conducted for a national-level data centre in China. The results indicate that a 5 MW hydrogen internal combustion engine waste heat cooling system can achieve zero carbon emissions during the operational phase, with instantaneous cooling capacity reaching 897.7 kW, representing a 64%-166% improvement over traditional air-cooled and water-cooled systems, thereby validating the feasibility of low-carbon data centres and the synergistic application of waste heat cooling."

    "abstract": "This study employs transfer learning with the YOLOv8 model to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs within real-world clinical environments. The model was trained using the publicly available NODE21 dataset, comprising 1,134 chest X-rays annotated with 1,476 nodules. Performance assessment was conducted on an independent dataset consisting of 64 radiographs from the “Marius Nasta” Institute of Pneumology (Bucharest, Romania), involving patients with biopsy-confirmed lung cancer. To ensure dataset consistency, images exhibiting extensive disease, atelectasis, pleural effusion, or more than three nodules were excluded. The trained model attained an accuracy of 65% on the NODE21 dataset; however, its performance declined to 32% on the independent clinical dataset, highlighting challenges in generalizing to real-world cases—particularly those involving large pulmonary masses (>3 cm), which were underrepresented in the training data. Nevertheless, the YOLOv8 model effectively detected smaller nodules (<3 cm) and those overlapping mediastinal structures, which are often difficult for radiologists to identify. These findings indicate that, despite limitations in detecting larger lesions, the model may offer utility in preliminary screenings or as a supplementary tool for radiologists, especially in identifying subtle or obscured nodules during routine chest X-ray evaluations."

However, SiC devices impose more stringent requirements on gate-drive circuits, rendering traditional MOSFET drivers inadequate in terms of switching speed, high-voltage isolation, accurate protection and other critical functions. Therefore, developing a highly reliable, wide-bandwidth SiC gate-driver with comprehensive protection features is of significant research value. This thesis presents a gate-drive solution for highspeed SiC MOSFETs that centers on Texas Instruments' isolated gate-driver chip UCC21710. The design methodology is elaborated from the perspectives of driving principles, circuit implementation, signal integrity and protection strategies, supported by detailed schematics; Ultimately realizing reliable gate control for both high- and low-voltage sides."

Any inconsistency among these models, which occurs rather frequently, directly affects the performance, reliability, and effectiveness of a DT.

    "abstract": "Wearables are increasingly popular and are being accepted in healthcare applications, such as monitoring activity and heart rate. Like other wireless sensors, time synchronization is an important issue to ensure the credibility of data. While studies in this area are not uncommon, most methods try to synchronize the clock on individual devices and require access to the hardware and modification to the firmware. We consider a case for consumer wearables, where there is zero access to both firmware and hardware of the devices, except listening to the streaming data passively, and all synchronization can only be done on the receiving end. We present a two-part approach to synchronize streaming data received from wearable sensors. First, the fixed time offset due to device processing time is corrected by a one-time calibration. Second, the random time offset due to wireless communication is corrected by finetuning the sampling rate. Instead of adjusting the time on separate devices, the method attempts to align data from different devices to the accuracy of one sample time. The synchronization method also considers situations of data loss, congested Bluetooth channels, and multiple receiving hubs. With further interpolation on the received data, a synchronization accuracy of 1 ms is achieved. Unlike existing methods that rely on embedded timestamps, synchronized start events, or firmware modifications, our technique operates entirely on the receiver side, achieving single sample accuracy even under packet loss and clock drift."

    "abstract": "Olfactory perception arises from the synergistic activation of multiple receptors, each exhibiting distinct affinity for recognizing specific odors. However, accurately identifying the olfactory receptor corresponding to particular odors, i.e., receptor-odor interactions, remains a significant challenge due to incomplete understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning approach that integrates graph neural network with attention mechanism-based fusion strategy. This approach models the spatial structure feature among olfactory receptors, and aims to construct a receptorodor interaction mapping using the curated dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identify the receptor-odor interaction relationship, achieving an accuracy of 93.5 %, and significantly outperforming existing deep learning models and recognition method. Additionally, the method exhibits robust on external real-world samples, and accurately recognize receptor interactions involved in odor perception, with substantial improvements across all performance metrics. Finally, we construct an odor-receptor space distribution to elucidate the structural organization of diverse odors, highlighting receptor clustering patterns for each odor. The proposed method offers valuable insights into the biological mechanisms of olfaction, provides a promising framework for odor-related disease diagnosis, and delivers practical guidance for the design of electronic nose systems."

The robot is controlled by solving the inverse kinematics to move the end-effector toward the target. A key contribution is a Mamdani-type Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that dynamically adjusts the proportional control gain based on the x and y position errors, overcoming the speed-accuracy trade-off of a fixed-gain controller.

The primary method for diabetes detection in current clinical practice is blood sample analysis, which minimizes the uncertainty of invasive tests. Monitoring daily behaviors can identify at-risk groups early for intervention before clinical symptoms develop. This approach increases testing convenience and captures vital moments for disease management. This study aims to use machine learning to enable pre-diagnosis for potential teenage diabetes patients prior to blood tests. Logistic regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classification (SVC), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models are utilized to assess the connection between diabetes and lifestyle habits. Results show that the XGBoost model is the most effective, failing to identify 20.34 % of diabetes cases and misdiagnosing 26.67 % of patients. Additionally, General Health, Body Mass Index, and High Blood Pressure emerge as the most significant factors linked to diabetes in teenagers. All models achieved convergence, ensuring the accuracy of the results. By using machine learning, healthcare professionals can pre-diagnose teenage diabetic patients, significantly reducing costs associated with blood tests."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in education; however, the responses frequently fail to capture learners' real-time progress or task context. This paper presents a Kanban-driven context engineering framework for LLM prompts that incorporates structured workflow data, including task states, deadlines, and activity logs, to improve pedagogical alignment and feedback accuracy. Using the RAGAS assessment pipeline, the framework was tested across three LLMs (OpenAI/gpt-oss-120b, deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b, and gemma2-9b-it) to evaluate semantic similarity and response efficiency. The results demonstrate that OpenAI/gpt-oss-120b achieved the best balance of accuracy and latency, with an average similarity of 0.68 and a response time of 5.1 s, above the others. A usability test conducted with fifty graduate students provided an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.4, suggesting high acceptance and interaction quality. The findings show that a structured Kanban context enhances response relevance, interaction, and user satisfaction while being computationally efficient. This paradigm provides a scalable framework for creating context-aware pedagogical agents, connecting workflow analytics and adaptive learning, and directing future research on multimodal and self-regulated learning support."

The UAV routing strategy we proposed before considering the uses of UAVs on damaged component inspections, transmission line monitoring, and traffic monitoring together uses a fixed threshold of remaining energy as the judgmental condition. A fixed threshold cannot accurately reflect the energy consumed for UAVs returning to the depot. Therefore, this paper proposes a routing strategy considering the calculation of the energy consumed for returning, so that the UAV can implement more inspection or monitoring tasks. The calculation method is based on the analysis of the influence of wind speed on energy consumption. Afterwards, we test the proposed strategy using a real-life case calculation of energy in an area within Northeast China. The testing results show that using our proposed strategy, UAVs can perform more inspection and monitoring tasks in the post-disaster restoration cases."

    "abstract": "Driver drowsiness contributes significantly to road accidents, necessitating the development of effective real-time monitoring systems. Traditional drowsiness detection systems utilize behavioral or vehicular parameters but consistently lack real-time monitoring of actual physiological indicators. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) exhibits a great potential physiological marker to detect drowsiness because it shows how the autonomic nervous system operates while revealing changes in fatigue and alertness. The research analyses the application of real-time HRV data through different recurring neural network (RNN) architectural designs for driver drowsiness detection levels. The objective aims to identify driver drowsiness states, which include alert, early drowsiness, and severe drowsiness. The methodology incorporates three RNN architectures—Simple RNN, Bi-Directional RNN, and Deep RNN—alongside a preprocessing approach using a band-pass filter on heart rate data. Additionally, the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram method is applied in the frequency domain to extract features. Experimental findings show that a simple RNN achieves 86% of the accuracy through Adam optimizer training, and a bidirectional RNN reaches 87.00 % accuracy with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. Deep RNN demonstrated the most promising performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.68%. These findings reveal the potential of deep learning-based methods to detect drowsiness in real time through physiological signals. The study underscores that deep RNNs are highly effective in extracting temporal patterns from HRV data, enabling advances in driver monitoring systems with enhanced road safety benefits."

Leveraging key Python libraries such as Tensorflow, OpenCV, LLM and LabelImg, the system efficiently extracts important key point features to recognize gestures and convert them into sentences in sign language.

This work presents a deep learning-based speech signal augmentation model that is innovative. The proposed model consists of two phases: Training (i) and Testing (ii). In the training phase, the noisy input signal is processed using a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to estimate the signal and noise spectrums. The Wiener filter's features are then extracted using the Empirical Mean Decomposition (EMD) method. The Fractional Delta AMS characteristics are retrieved, the de-noised signal is obtained from the EMD, and the bark frequency is evaluated. Here, in this paper we’re using \"Learning with Learned Loss Function\", for improving PESQ score. The key contribution of this study is the precise estimate of the tuning factor η for the Wiener filter using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for each input signal. The extracted features (EMD), which were trained on the LSTM using a modified wiener filter to break down the spectral input, provide the denoised improved speech signal. A comparative analysis is carried out between the proposed and existing models with respect to error metrics."

    "abstract": "Near accurate estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from echocardiography is essential for the assessment of cardiovascular risks, but remains highly dependent on expert interpretation. We propose a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with attention-guided skip refinements for robust left ventricle segmentation and automated LVEF computation from echocardiogram video and image samples. Unlike conventional U-Net models, our approach integrates dense connections, feedback loops, and Progressive Distillation Attention Blocks (PDABs). The PDAB modules selectively refine shallow encoder features before fusion with decoder representations, enabling progressive distillation of fine spatial details and deeper semantic cues. This refinement strategy ensures the precise delineation of ventricular boundaries even in low-quality echocardiographic frames, directly improving the reliability of the estimation of ejection fraction. With only <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 4 M}$</tex> parameters, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

In terms of model structure, a serial network composed of a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed to extract temporal variation patterns from wind power data. In terms of knowledge transfer, a federated learning mechanism is introduced to learn shared knowledge among multiple wind turbines while protecting data privacy, thereby addressing the issue of insufficient samples. A parameter fine-tuning strategy is utilized to achieve personalized adaptation of shared knowledge, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the model on the target wind turbine. Experiments show that compared to traditional local training frameworks, the accuracy improvement of the federated transfer learning framework can reach up to 43.32%."

However, these tasks are still difficult because of overlap, heterogeneous nuclear morphology, and variations in diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. Using auto-calibrated DAB-intensity thresholds, we propose a real-time, lightweight framework for classifying individual nuclei into Strong, Moderate, Weak, and Negative categories. The pipeline separates the DAB signal, extracts nuclear contours, aggregates per-nucleus intensity, and uses calibrated, intensity-driven decision-making to assign a single label. By combining the percentage of positive nuclei with their dominant staining intensity, we calculate ROI-level Allred scores, building on the nucleus-level outputs. The University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) provided the primary dataset, and a hybrid automated-manual workflow with expert validation was used to create pixel-based ground truth for 250 PR-IHC images. This approach consistently performs well on a held-out test split (macro-F1 = 0.948; overall IoU = 0.906). The results demonstrate the usefulness of intensitydriven, computationally efficient techniques for Allred scoring and nucleus classification in digital pathology workflows. Instant Allred scoring without sophisticated computation is made possible by the lightweight design, which makes it appropriate for overloaded hospitals and clinics with limited resources."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the advancement of the GIGA School Initiative in Japan, the need to support students in understanding their own learning status and enabling self-regulated learning through the use of learning logs has grown increasingly important. In mathematics education in particular, acquiring new knowledge often depends on a solid understanding of prerequisite concepts. A lack of mastery in these foundational areas frequently leads to learning difficulties. Nonetheless, it is not easy for learners to identify which prerequisite knowledge needs to be reviewed, nor to independently select the next problem to tackle. This study proposes a Review-Target Knowledge Map (RTK Map) application, which utilizes subjective comprehension status (SCS) and binary scoring, recorded during problem-solving, to support learners in identifying their own review-target knowledge (RTK) and selecting which problems to work on. This system allows learners to record their SCS after solving each problem, then visualizes the knowledge and problems that require review based on that information and binary scoring. As a result of an implementation of this method in junior high school mathematics classes, SCS was recorded for approximately 17.7% of the problems, and positive responses were observed, such as students recognizing their areas of weakness and developing a motivation to review. In the future, we plan to apply this approach to physics learning and verify the effectiveness of the application through practical implementation at a high school."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of an increasing share of wind and solar power generation, packed bed thermal energy storage technology is regarded as a highly promising solution for addressing the intermittency and variability inherent in power production. This study employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on a local thermal non-equilibrium model to numerically investigate the resistance and heat transfer characteristics of a packed bed thermal energy storage tank. This paper focuses on the impact of particle diameter (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1-4 ~\\text{cm}$</tex>) and heat transfer fluid velocity <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathbf{0. 0 0 0 2 - 0. 0 0 0 8 ~ m} / \\mathrm{s})$</tex> on system performance. The results indicate that: (1) In terms of resistance characteristics, the pressure drop decreases non-linearly with increasing particle diameter (from 15.08 Pa at 1 cm to 4.07 Pa at 2 cm, and further to 1.16 Pa at 4 cm), while it increases almost linearly with fluid velocity; (2) Regarding heat transfer characteristics, increasing the particle diameter leads to a thicker thermal stratification layer and a significant reduction in charging and discharging efficiency (with a 31.3% drop in discharging efficiency), although it shortens the overall thermal storage and release time. In contrast, increasing the fluid velocity reduces the operation cycle, slightly increases the thermal layer thickness, but results in a relatively minor efficiency decline <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\leq 4 \\%)$</tex>; (3) The influence of particle diameter on efficiency is more pronounced than that of fluid velocity. Smaller particles (1 cm) yield higher charging and discharging efficiencies (0.94 and 0.83, respectively). From the perspective of balancing flow resistance and heat transfer performance, it is recommended that the diameter of the solid packing particles should not exceed 2 cm. The study demonstrates that the synergistic optimization of particle size and flow velocity is crucial for achieving high efficiency and low resistance, providing a theoretical foundation for the engineering application of packed bed thermal energy storage systems."

Our approach closes the gap between theoretical security models and real-world network contexts and offers an educational and research-based environment to study wireless vulnerability. Performance outcomes identify attack patterns under varied network settings and the capability of the framework to represent attacker strategy and network resilience."

    "abstract": "The breakdown and degradation characteristics of ester-based dielectric liquids subjected to nanosecond impulses have been investigated and compared with those of conventional mineral oil. Experiments were performed using a ten-stage Marx generator delivering impulses across electrode configurations with varying field utilization factors. Two complementary studies were undertaken. First, a breakdown study was conducted, in which breakdown voltage, time to breakdown, and peak breakdown current were measured under both positive and negative polarities. Following this, a degradation study, where each liquid was subjected to 500 consecutive impulses prior to reevaluation under 25-kV ac partial discharge (PD) diagnostics, was undertaken. Results confirm the strong polarity dependence of nanosecond impulse breakdown, with higher breakdown voltages and longer time to breakdown observed under negative polarity. Ester liquids exhibited breakdown voltages comparable to mineral oil, but with consistently shorter delay times, indicating faster streamer initiation. In degradation tests, electrode conditioning produced apparent increases in breakdown voltage; however, PD measurements revealed that mineral oil experienced significantly greater deterioration, with larger increases in both peak and average PD. In contrast, both natural and synthetic esters showed more moderate degradation, with synthetic ester demonstrating the highest stability. The findings support the use of ester liquids as technically viable alternatives to mineral oil for pulsed power insulation applications."

    "abstract": "Direct measurement of the particle velocity distribution function (VDF) of neutral gases and plasmas allows for their thermodynamic characterization (temperature, density, and velocity vector) and is of crucial importance for fields such as aeronautics, aerospace, microelectronics, etc. In recent years, the mechanical probes that have formed the state of the art — Pitot tubes, hot wires, Langmuir probes, etc. — are steadily being replaced by laser-based diagnostic techniques. Among the latter, single-shot coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS), a four-wave mixing technique, has been demonstrated to perform VDF characterization of atomic and molecular species within a single laser shot (∼ 100 ns). CRBS requires the use of highly specialized laser systems capable of generating laser beams with controllable chirps, variable pulse duration, controllable pulse shaping, and high pulse energies. However, the characterization of environments exhibiting fast flows, such as gas boundary layers, or low particle number densities, such as low-temperature glow discharges, have proven extremely challenging with current state-of-the-art laser systems mainly due to the need for pulse energies beyond 1 J. In this work, we report on the improvement of a custom nanosecond-pulsed laser system tailored for optical particle diagnostics and manipulation, and which is capable of pulse energies exceeding 2 Joule/pulse. In addition to the notable output energy, the laser system is capable of generating laser pulses with customizable temporal profiles and variable durations (10 ns to 1 μs), with a chirping range of several GHz over the pulse duration. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the highest reported energy per pulse generated by a lab-scale frequency-chirped laser source at nanosecond timescales. The expanded output energy range is anticipated to greatly broaden the laser system’s application potential via CRBS for thermodynamic diagnostics of both supersonic/hypersonic gas flows in wind tunnel and shock-tube facilities, as well as plasma species in space-like conditions, e.g. ion thrusters."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia detection from chest X-rays remains a challenging task due to variations in image quality, overlapping features, and the need for precise localization of affected regions. Traditional CNN-based models, while effective, often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and global contextual information. Transformer models, on the other hand, excel in self-attention mechanisms but require extensive data and computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose an improved hybrid Transformer-CNN model that integrates the local feature extraction capability of CNNs with the global attention mechanisms of Transformers. Multi-scale feature fusion enhances representation learning, while contrastive learning improves model robustness. Additionally, a Bayesian segmentation approach refines the localization of pneumonia-affected lung regions, improving interpretability. Knowledge distillation is employed to enable lightweight deployment without compromising performance. Experimental results on benchmark chest X-ray datasets show that our proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 94.8%, outperforming traditional CNNs by 6.5% and standalone Transformers by 4.2%. The segmentation precision is improved by 7.3%, enabling more accurate identification of pneumonia-affected areas. These advancements contribute to a more reliable and interpretable AI-driven pneumonia detection system."

    "abstract": "Face recognition is now the most used biometric mode; however, it is vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing attacks include image-printed attacks, video replay attacks, 3D mask attacks, and so on, necessitating the implementation of appropriate anti-spoofing methods. Previous methods for early liveness identification used handcrafted techniques such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or Histogram of Orientated Gradients (HOG) to analyze texture variations between real and synthetic faces. Without a doubt, these methods were computationally efficient, but they proved ineffective against sophisticated attacks such as high-resolution printouts or 3D masks. Aside from the methodologies used in the referred models, researchers interested in improving face identification presented CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) solutions. However, despite their high accuracy in terms of outcomes, deep-learning methods are computationally expensive, require large amounts of data, and are not generalizable when compared to other spoofing approaches. As a result, the paper suggests a lightweight strategy that does not use deep learning but integrates security, efficiency, and scalability into the output. It distinguishes between authentic, and spoof faces by utilizing handmade extraction techniques such as histograms of orientated gradients (HOG), local binary patterns (LBP), and Gabor. These collected characteristics are identified using machine learning-optimized ensemble models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost, which ensure high generalization while requiring minimal CPU resources. This model is up to 99% efficient in terms of accuracy and processing resources. This is one of the first experiments to achieve more than 99% accuracy in facial recognition using a lightweight, non-deep learning technique. Unlike prior research, which concentrated on CNNs or specialized customized techniques, our hybrid system combines LBP, HOG, and Gabor features with ensemble machine learning classifiers (SVM, RF, XGBoost) to provide real-time, scalable security suitable for low-resource applications.

In this paper, we investigate critical stages of the multiprocessor system boot process and identify a new, prevalent hardware supply-chain attack surface that can bypass secure boot due to the absence of processor-authentication mechanisms. To defend against such attacks, in this paper, we present PA-Boot, the first formally verified processor-authentication protocol for secure boot in multiprocessor systems. PA-Boot is proved functionally correct and is guaranteed to detect multiple adversarial behaviors, such as processor replacements and man-in-the-middle attacks. The fine-grained formalization of PA-Boot and its fully mechanized security proofs are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover with 348 lemmas/theorems and ~7,100 LoC. We further implement in C an instance of PA-Boot. Experiments on the proof-of-concept implementation indicate that PA-Boot can effectively identify boot-process attacks with a minor overhead (4.98% on Linux boot process) and thereby improve the security of multiprocessor systems."

However, such systems are vulnerable to AI-driven attacks, including adversarial prompts and manipulated inputs that can mislead retrieval outcomes. To address this, we propose SHRC-Net, a secure and robust multimodal image retrieval framework that integrates Semantic Harmonization and Region Composition. The architecture comprises three core modules: a Semantic Harmonization Unit (SHU) that aligns textual semantics with fine-grained visual regions, an Adaptive Region Composer (ARC) that captures region-level dependencies under semantic guidance, and a Unified Training Objective (UTO) that incorporates alignment, attention regularization, and compositional classification losses. SHRC-Net builds target-aware representations that faithfully reflect user intent while enhancing resistance to adversarial manipulations. The framework is trained end-to-end without requiring additional annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SHRC-Net achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance, while also exhibiting strong robustness against ambiguous or malicious queries. These results underscore its potential for secure deployment in AI-powered consumer electronics systems."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of time-synchronized measurements in smart grids has accelerated the development of machine learning-based data-driven attack detection methods, which have been widely adopted due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, these methods typically assume that the data in the training and deployment phases share an identical distribution, which can be violated when the configurations or components of the deployment system change. Undoubtedly, such domain shift scenarios can harm the attack detection performance. In this work, we tackle this issue by performing domain adaptive and representation learning in one coherent framework termed Domain Adaptive Representation Learning (DARL). First, the nonlinear oscillation modes in sensor measurements during system transients are captured by Koopman mode decomposition. Second, DARL incorporates a hierarchical alignment strategy to reduce the cross-domain discrepancy, which is achieved by performing global distribution and instance-wise feature alignment. Then, DARL learns the target intrinsic structure and representation in a self-supervised manner to avoid over-reliance on source supervision. Extensive case studies on IEEE test systems demonstrate that DARL significantly outperforms baselines in various domain shift scenarios, achieving the smallest detection accuracy drops in target domains."

The pivot motion, executed by a position-controlled robotic arm, enables the gripper to effectively grasp hollow objects placed horizontally such that one gripper finger is positioned inside the object’s hole, while the other contacts its outer surface along the length. Hole grasp is widely employed by humans to manipulate hollow objects, facilitating precise placement and enabling efficient subsequent operations, such as tightly packing objects into trays or accurately inserting them into narrow machine slots in manufacturing processes. Asymmetric pivoting for hole grasping is applicable to hollow objects of various sizes and hole shapes, including bottles, cups, and ducts. We investigate the variable parameters that satisfy the force balance conditions for successful grasping configurations. Our method can be implemented using a commercially available parallel-jaw gripper installed directly on a robot arm without modification. Experimental verification confirmed that hole grasp can be achieved using our proposed asymmetric pivot manipulation for various hollow objects, demonstrating a high success rate. Two use cases, namely aligning and feeding hollow cylindrical objects, were experimentally demonstrated on the testbed to clearly showcase the advantages of the hole grasp approach."

However, prior research has not fully addressed the joint optimization of service placement and workflow scheduling, particularly the exploitation of task parallelism to reduce overall makespan. To address this shortcoming, we explore the combined workflow scheduling and service placement (WSP-SP) problem with the goal of minimizing the average makespan of applications. Recognizing that WSP-SP is NP-hard, we propose a two-stage, Parallelism Aware Workflow Scheduling and Service Placement strategy (PAWSSP) that minimizes the makespan with low complexity. In the first stage, a Parallelism Aware Service Placement module (PASP) is designed to adjust the service layout by allocating services with high parallelism onto distinct servers to fully leverage task-level concurrency. In the subsequent workflow scheduling stage, PAWSSP determines task priority by resolving inter-task competition and further reduces waiting times by assigning tasks to servers experiencing lower resource contention. We further extend PAWSSP to make it applicable to both offline and online scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PAWSSP performs robustly across diverse scenarios, reducing the average makespan by 3.9%-14.7% compared to existing baselines, while maintaining modest runtime overhead."

Instead, we uncover a new architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable real-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder feedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter’s coding strategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link diversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband, interference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a downlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this vision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback (O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive RF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant uplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight that inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full potential of hybrid wireless networks."

Building on Expectation Propagation (EP), we propose Gaussian Mixture EP (GMEP), which curbs EP’s reliance on multiple iterations caused by negative-variance updates. GMEP replaces only unstable symbol-wise Gaussian messages with a small, bounded-order mixture, so most messages remain single-Gaussian and per-iteration cost stays close to MMSE/EP. This stabilizes detection early, avoids repeated matrix inversions, and achieves EP-level accuracy with fewer iterations and lower overall complexity. Benefits grow with antenna count and modulation order, making GMEP especially effective for large-scale MIMO. Results on large arrays and high-order constellations confirm consistent accuracy gains under tight iteration budgets with minimal overhead."

Extreme viewpoint variations and the complexity of real-world scenes present significant challenges to this task. However, current methods primarily focus on learning single-scale features, which may be inadequate for practical applications. Although some approaches attempt to incorporate multi-scale representations, they may suffer from unimodal bias arising from structural discrepancies among model branches, limiting effective multi-scale feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose a fully multi-branch network architecture, named BEMN, which is designed to learn multi-scale robust feature representations. Specifically, we construct a multi-branch backbone network based on pretrained visual models and design a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a separate training scheme is employed to thoroughly optimize each branch of the network, and a joint feature alignment (JFA) module is introduced to align cross-view features. The entire network is fine-tuned in the second stage, where a frequency domain adjustment (FDA) module is designed to improve performance. To further assess the generalization ability of CVGL methods, we establish Xian-37, a highly challenging CVGL test dataset featuring complex real scenes captured from diverse platforms and viewpoints. Experimental results across multiple public benchmarks validate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating outstanding generalization capabilities.

Firstly, a mathematical model considering multiple disturbances of the electromechanical fin actuators is established. Secondly, the closed-loop uncertainty quantification analysis is conducted using an experimental platform, revealing the influence mechanism of multiple disturbances. Thirdly, a composite control scheme is designed based on the characteristics of the dominant disturbances, while accurately estimating, simultaneously compensating for and attenuating these disturbances. Specifically, a multi-harmonic disturbance observer is employed to precisely estimate the dominant disturbances, and a composite controller is developed to track the desired angle under deflection angle constraints. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the disturbance observer based PID control and active disturbance rejection control, the proposed scheme can enhance both disturbance estimation accuracy and deflection angle tracking performance."

    "abstract": "The primary challenge confronting traditional strapdown inertial navigation systems/refractive celestial navigation systems (SINSs/RCNSs) is the inaccuracy of atmospheric modeling, which significantly degrades navigation accuracy. To address this issue, this paper introduces a navigation method assisted by dual-band stellar refraction. This method corrects the atmospheric density error by observing dual-band stellar refraction. By capitalizing on the variance in refraction information between two distinct bands of starlight traversing the atmosphere of Earth, a mapping relationship is established between dual-band stellar refraction observations and the atmospheric density error. This relationship facilitates the online calibration of the atmospheric density error through least squares estimation. Simulations based on typical scenarios indicate that the proposed method effectively compensates for the atmospheric density error under different model assumptions, such as constant, Brownian, and spatiotemporal perturbations. The navigation accuracy improves on average by more than 73% compared with the uncompensated atmospheric density error, effectively resolving the navigation result divergence issue before calibration. This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy of the SINS/RCNS."

    "abstract": "Industrial systems require effective anomaly detection and predictive maintenance strategies to prevent unexpected failures and optimize operational efficiency. However, traditional approaches often treat anomaly detection and failure prediction as independent tasks, limiting their ability to leverage operational patterns for early fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel two-stage hybrid deep learning framework that integrates unsupervised anomaly detection with supervised failure prediction through cross-domain transfer learning. The framework first employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract latent anomaly embeddings from HVAC system operational data without requiring labeled anomalies. These embeddings are transferred and combined with sensor readings from a predictive maintenance dataset to enrich the failure prediction model. Experimental evaluations on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, with notable improvements in accuracy (90.2%), precision (0.89), recall (0.90), F1-score (0.90), and AUC-ROC (0.873). Additionally, the approach exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability, highlighting its potential applicability across different industrial environments. This work introduces a scalable and flexible anomaly-driven transfer learning strategy that addresses the scarcity of labeled failure data and enhances the robustness of predictive maintenance systems. The findings suggest that integrating unsupervised operational insights into supervised learning frameworks is a promising direction for advancing intelligent industrial monitoring."

To address these shortcomings, we propose a dynamic and secure multi-keyword search scheme with a two-factor verification mechanism, named Mimi. Specifically, Mimi first constructs a dynamic verification tree structure to accelerate the verification of the correctness of returned results. Second, it builds an encrypted searchable index that supports sub-linear search time complexity. Third, Mimi incorporates a secure symmetric key exchange protocol to protect the confidentiality of the symmetric key. Furthermore, Mimi supports multi-user search operations without increasing the index construction costs and accommodates dynamic updates to both user roles and data. Through comprehensive security analysis, we demonstrate that Mimi ensures the security of the encrypted searchable inverted index and maintains query indistinguishability for users. Empirical evaluations show that the Mimi scheme is efficient and effective."

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted telesurgery has proven its effectiveness in enhancing situational awareness for clinician-side teleoperators. However, for patient-side surgical assistants, existing systems lack intuitive and safe interaction strategies to mitigate preoperative infection risks and intraoperative collisions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a multifunctional proximity-aware skin that integrates multizone Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensing for interaction during both preoperative and intraoperative phases of AR-assisted telesurgery. On the patient side, a monocular camera providing AR visualization is mounted at the end of a robotic arm equipped with the skin. The skin uses a time-division multiplexing strategy to eliminate crosstalk and ensure reliable proximity awareness. During preoperative preparation, the skin-based contactless teleoperation allows surgical assistants to adjust the AR robotic arm for a high-quality field of view, while the contactless gesture recognition enables mode switching between rotation, translation, and locking. In the intraoperative phase, the skin facilitates obstacle avoidance to ensure patient-side safe assistance. Accuracy evaluations demonstrate effective crosstalk suppression under the proposed time-division multiplexing strategy. Functional experiments, laparoscopic phantom and tissue tests, as well as user studies validate the system's effectiveness to improve patient-side assistance."

The first involves designing a prototype with electronic components that generate control signals through three PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins with varying intensity. The resulting voltage is measured through an analog pin in different phases for each color card. These values are then normalized and arranged into a matrix, which serves as input for a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In the second stage, the MLP is trained and validated using the data collected in the first stage. The dataset was automatically divided by MATLAB into subsets for training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%). Validation was performed during the model training by monitoring the error on the validation set using the train function. The model was then evaluated in real time with new sensor readings to verify its ability to correctly identify colors not included in the training data. The network is configured to classify each card into one of five predefined colors: Black, White, Blue, Red, or Green. Based on the result, a servo motor is adjusted to visually represent the identified color.The system performance was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and the correlation coefficient (R), showing that the prototype can reliably classify colors based on the voltage patterns."

    "abstract": "With the recent development of a globalized society, communication skills using foreign languages other than one's native language have become indispensable. On the other hand, it is generally considered difficult to acquire a language at the native level after the critical period, the period during which language learning functions can be acquired. Although school attendance is an effective way to learn a foreign language, time and financial constraints often make this impractical. If it becomes possible to learn foreign language pronunciation through self-study, it is expected to greatly shorten the learning process. This paper describes a pronunciation judgment system for foreign language learning that uses machine learning. The target language is Japanese, and we train the machine learning system by providing it with audio data of words that are difficult to distinguish for non-native speakers and then build a system that judges whether the pronounced words are correct or not. For machine learning, we use Google Teachable Machine, a free service. Experiments based on this method showed that the recognition accuracy for native Japanese pronunciation was 94.6%, and the recognition accuracy for pronunciation by non-native Japanese learners was 87.5%, indicating that we have built a system that can make judgments with a high degree of accuracy."

First, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment index system was established, incorporating multi-dimensional parameters such as power flow variation factor, voltage fault index, load index, and power flow incremental margin. Second, a combined weighting strategy integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and entropy weight method (EWM) was adopted, and an improved butterfly optimization algorithm (IBOA) was introduced to optimize the composite vulnerability index. Finally, simulations on a modified IEEE39-node system with wind power integration validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, generating a valuable set of cascading failure chains. The results demonstrate that the method can accurately identify critical lines in the grid, providing a new technical approach for enhancing the security of power systems with high renewable energy penetration."

    "abstract": "Chest radiography is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools in clinical practice, yet a significant proportion of images suffer from technical deficiencies that compromise their diagnostic value. Common errors such as patient rotation, incomplete lung field inclusion, or the presence of artifacts can lead to unnecessary radiation exposure, reduced workflow efficiency, and inaccurate diagnoses. Studies indicate that between 5 % and 15 % of chest X-rays are technically inadequate, directly affecting care quality and increasing healthcare costs. Mandatory hospital audits often reveal these issues, but lack objective tools to address them systematically. In this context, CHYMERA (CHest x-raY Machine LEarning Audit) emerges as a comprehensive AI-powered solution designed to automate and standardize the quality control of chest radiographs. Leveraging deep learning techniques and modular components for anatomical analysis, segmentation, artifact detection, and technical classification, CHYMERA delivers interpretable, reproducible, and real-time assessments. Its integration into clinical workflows through an intuitive interface, along with its audit-ready capabilities-such as performance tracking by operator or session-make it a strategic asset for hospitals aiming to reduce variability, comply with regulatory standards, and enhance patient safety. This multidimensional approach not only improves technical image quality but also optimizes healthcare resources and strengthens trust in radiology services."

The YOLO-v8 model offers the optimal balance between accuracy and response time, making it the most suitable choice for lymphatic nodes detection in real-time video acquisition. YOLO-v8 was evaluated on the collected data, achieving a global detection precision of 89.3 % with a response time of 20 ms.

In this paper a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the problem is explored for the setting where the motion model for the object/target to be tracked is unknown to the observer. It is assumed that the target dynamics are stationary in time, the state space and the observation space are discrete, and there is complete observability of the location of the target under certain (a priori unknown) sensor control actions. Then, a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) rather than POMDP formulation is proposed for the tracking problem with controlled sensing, which is termed as Track-MDP. In contrast to the POMDP formulation, the Track-MDP formulation is amenable to an RL based solution. It is shown that the optimal policy for the Track-MDP formulation, which is approximated through RL, is guaranteed to track all significant target paths with certainty. The Track-MDP method is then compared with the optimal POMDP policy, and it is shown that the infinite horizon tracking reward of the optimal Track-MDP policy is the same as that of the optimal POMDP policy. In simulations it is demonstrated that Track-MDP based RL can lead to a policy that can track the target with high accuracy and superior energy efficiency."

Relying on multi-hop communications, one of the critical metrics in such a system is latency. In this paper, our objective is to characterize the latency performance of the roadside deployment of an IAB system operating in the millimeter wave band (mmWave). To this end, we first utilize queuing theory tools to capture the dynamics of the buffering process at intermediate nodes with bursty arrival and service processes in the uplink and downlink directions. We then apply stochastic geometry to parameterize the model with radio part parameters. We address both user-and operator-related metrics, including packet latency and resource utilization coefficient. Our numerical results show that in roadside IAB deployment, backhaul is the main bottleneck, as the number of IAB nodes that can be supported by a donor is mainly affected by the number of users and traffic they generate, even for large bandwidths supported by 5G mmWave NR systems. The mean latency in the system scales exponentially as a function of the number of hops supported by the donor, implying that congestion in such a system is partial, affecting only the last few nodes in the chain. We demonstrate that an efficient way to adapt deployment to road traffic conditions is to fix the minimal modulation and coding scheme at the backhaul links by appropriately choosing the inter-IAB node distance. The proposed model provides a ready-to-use tool for estimating the optimal distance between IAB nodes for a given road, system traffic conditions, and number of IAB nodes associated with a single IAB donor."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Its diagnosis poses significant challenges, often depending on the resources and capacities available within healthcare institutions. The analysis of data from various sources has enabled the development of models based on artificial and computational intelligence. In this study, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models were applied to classify electronic medical reports for TB detection. Their performance was compared with that of traditional natural language processing (NLP) approaches to evaluate improvements in classification accuracy. Results indicate that BERT is a promising strategy for this specific task, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 71.81% in the best scenario, which depends on computational resources and data availability."

    "abstract": "Persistent key-value stores on SSDs, such as RocksDB, are critical to many data-intensive services where performance is tightly coupled with I/O workload behavior. However, existing studies often rely on synthetic benchmarks like YCSB, which may overlook key aspects of real I/O behavior and request-size variation, leading to incomplete or misleading performance insights. This paper presents a fine-grained workload analysis of YCSB-driven RocksDB traces on SSDs using a public dataset. We extract aggregate statistics including total I/O volume, read/write ratios, IOPS, and request sizes, and further examine temporal dynamics and request-size distributions through detailed visualizations. Our analysis reveals strongly read-dominated workloads with extreme burstiness and a bimodal request-size pattern, reflecting interference between foreground and background tasks. These findings demonstrate the limitations of benchmark averages and provide insights for optimizing storage design and RocksDB tuning."

    "abstract": "Architecture modeling is an essential part of model-driven development of safety-critical software. AADL is a modeling language standard for designing and analyzing safety-critical software. However, there is usually a large gap between software requirements and architectural design. Effectively transforming requirements into formal software architecture models relies on a lot of manual experience and iterative exploration. To address these challenges, we conduct an exploratory study of LLM-supported AADL architecture modeling. We assess three powerful LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeekV3, and GLM-4-Plus. First, we decompose and refine high-level software requirements and design constraints, mapping them to the proposed prompt engineering framework, RNL-Prompt, which significantly improved the accuracy of LLMs in generating different modeling elements. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 perform on par with each other, and both outperform GLM-4-Plus in complex modeling elements, such as modes, behavior annex, etc. Second, to enhance the potential of GLM-4-Plus, we optimize its performance using N-shot prompting and retrievalaugmented generation (RAG). The results indicate that N-shot prompting performs more effectively. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in generating AADL architecture models in five examples of safety-critical domains. In addition, we implement an LLM-based modeling tool based on the AADL open source environment OSATE, which supports GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and GLM-4-Plus. The tool is successfully applied to the modeling of an avionics control system in the industry."

However, most studies have only used RGB images as input. Incorporating multiple color spaces simultaneously can capture complementary spectral characteristics and improve classification accuracy. In this study, we proposed a dual-branch DenseNet121 model for classifying corn leaf diseases. The model processed images in both RGB and HLS color spaces separately. Each branch extracted features independently, with a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) applied at the end of each branch to improve the network’s focus on the most informative image regions. This dual-branch design exploited the complementary strengths of both RGB and HLS color spaces by combining their features, providing the model with more comprehensive and discriminative representations to improve disease classification. The evaluation conducted on the PlantVillage dataset showed an accuracy of 98.38%, outperforming other CNN-based models. These findings demonstrated that integrating multiple color spaces with attention mechanisms was an effective approach for plant disease detection."

This article presents a multi-level model that supports the entire cycle from the preparation, implementation, and evaluation of courses on conceptual modeling in general and on MLM in particular.

Although much work has focused on evaluating the correctness of AI-based model creation, it remains important to assess whether and to what extent LLMs introduce unintended modifications in parts of the input model that they are merely expected to reproduce. Previous research has primarily focused on the success of programming and modeling tasks using AI, such as achieving syntactic and semantic correctness. In contrast, this work investigates the side effects of AI usage, specifically the introduction of unintended modifications during iterative modeling processes. We evaluate the likelihood of error introduction in an AI-based modeling approach for uncommon DSLs and use the perplexity-metric to identify error prone elements in the model. We use our own modeling language for class diagrams CD4A, an LLM that is not trained on this DSL and prompt it with simple modeling tasks. Next, we measure additional changes to the model that are not related to the given modeling task. We show that AI-driven Modeling approaches need to also focus on side effects of iterative LLM usage with unfamiliar modeling languages, and demonstrate how these risks can be identified."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of IoT devices has reshaped everyday environments into data-intensive ecosystems, but this transformation has also amplified the demand for real-time processing and energy-efficient resource management. Meeting these demands requires more than static scheduling policies; it calls for intelligent, adaptive strategies capable of keeping pace with dynamic and unpredictable workloads. We present a practical reinforcement learning framework that automatically decides where and when to offload and schedule tasks across a tightly integrated IoT–fog–cloud, adapting to changing workloads, network conditions and resource availability. Our approach builds upon Double Q-Learning, enhanced with parallelized decision-making that enables fog and cloud servers to jointly evaluate CPU demand, energy consumption and response time. To further improve adaptability, we incorporate an adaptive learning mechanism that continuously balances exploration and exploitation, allowing the system to respond effectively to fluctuating conditions and heterogeneous resources. Through iterative refinement, the framework learns execution policies that strike a balance between responsiveness and sustainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces average task response time by 5% and energy consumption by 11% compared with leading alternatives. These results highlight the potential of parallelized and adaptive reinforcement learning as a powerful solution for managing large-scale IoT ecosystems, where efficiency and agility are equally critical."

By integrating industrial production line conditions, a three-dimensional model of a shell-and-tube molten salt heat exchanger was established, and the Fluent numerical simulation method was employed to systematically investigate the influence patterns of molten salt temperature and flow velocity within the heat exchanger on the aluminum ingot preheating process. The research findings reveal that, under constant molten salt temperature conditions, the heating rate of aluminum ingots exhibits a positive correlation with molten salt flow velocity, albeit with a notable marginal diminishing effect. Specifically, in the low-flow velocity range (0.1–0.5 m/s), heating efficiency improves by 7.6%, whereas in the high-flow velocity range (1.0–1.5 m/s), the improvement is below 1%. At the same flow velocity, a 20°C increase in molten salt temperature results in an average 12% enhancement in heating efficiency, with a more pronounced effect observed in lower temperature ranges. Comparative analysis indicates that temperature regulation significantly outperforms flow velocity adjustment in optimizing heating rates. This study offers a low-carbon preheating solution for the metal processing industry, holding substantial engineering application value for advancing green transformation in manufacturing."

We consider that the scale parameter of the inverse Gaussian distribution is linearly related with the shape parameter, while the scale parameter is regarded as a random variable. Further, the proposed distribution model is extended to accelerated life test for improving the applicability of inverse Gaussian distribution in reliability engineering. EM algorithm is adopted for parameter estimation. The validity and stability of the parameter estimation method are verified by simulation studies."

This study introduces an enhanced timeliness framework termed Improved Age of Information (IAoI), which incorporates extreme event occurrences and higher-order statistical analysis of AoI exceedances. Through a holistic sensing-communication-control paradigm, the proposed framework coordinates multidimensional Power Internet of Things (PIoT) resources for IAOI assurance. We develop an augmented DQN-based methodology featuring a dual-buffer experience replay architecture that stores operational data samples. The training process integrates two distinct sampling mechanisms combining priority-based IAOI-DT metrics and stochastic selection to accelerate model convergence. Furthermore, an adaptive <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\varepsilon$</tex>-greedy exploration mechanism dynamically modulates action choices according to environmental feedback and neural network learning patterns, thereby strengthening comprehensive search capacity while preventing premature convergence.

This paper proposes a generator start-up strategy that explicitly incorporates dynamic frequency security constraints. Key constraints, including the Rate of Change of Frequency and frequency nadir, are formulated to ensure system stability. To mitigate the modeling errors introduced by linearization, a compensation mechanism is developed to improve accuracy. Additionally, to avoid the computational complexity of dynamic line capacity constraints, these are excluded from the main optimization process and instead verified post-solution. If violations are detected, steady-state line power limits are dynamically adjusted to reserve sufficient margin for transient power. The objective function minimizes the costs of conventional generation and load shedding, subject to both secure operation constraints and dynamic frequency constraints. A case study on a modified IEEE 57-bus system demonstrates that the proposed strategy enables rapid load restoration and cost-efficient recovery, significantly improving system resilience and stability in the aftermath of disasters."

Then we analyze the typical complex meteorological environment that may be encountered during the carrier-based aircraft landing process, and we study the effectiveness and applicability of the photoelectric guidance system under the above complex environment. Finally, we carry out carrier-based aircraft landing simulation experiments under complex environments, and analyze the landing characteristics of carrier-based aircraft under the above environments.

This paper considers the security-critical stochastic real-time task model, and introduces a cryptographic algorithm to encrypt the sensitive data of tasks, then establish the vulnerability model of real-time tasks. Due to that encryption of data can result in more time overhead, we model the no-deadline violation probability model and energy model of each task, and formulate the design optimization problem of security-driven stochastic real-time tasks.

    "abstract": "AC microgrids with high distributed energy resources (DERs) penetration frequently transition between grid-connected and islanded modes, causing significant variations in power flow, network topology, and fault levels. These dynamics challenge conventional overcurrent protection, as fixed-setting relays lack adaptability and offline-adaptive relays depend on manual updates, leading to unreliable coordination and delayed fault isolation. This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN) based on-the-fly adaptive overcurrent protection scheme that continuously monitors real-time system data, including fault currents and rate-of-change-of-frequency (ROCOF) element, to detect mode transitions and autonomously update relay settings, including pickup current and time dial. By incorporating the ROCOF element, the DNN-assisted relays maintain selectivity and enable rapid fault clearing amid sudden system changes. Simulation studies on a modified CIGRÉ AC microgrid demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional protection in speed and accuracy."

    "abstract": "The significant and rapid changes in the output of wind farms connected to weak grid structures can cause significant voltage fluctuations, which can easily trigger fault ride through actions and affect the reliable operation of the units and the stable operation of the power grid. This article proposes a quantitative method for quantifying the dynamic reactive power margin size that should be reserved for wind farm group SVG to smooth voltage fluctuations and prevent high/low voltage fault ride through actions;Taking into account the dynamic reactive power margin reserved by SVG, a steady-state reactive power and voltage control model for wind farms was further established. Multiple reactive power and voltage control objectives were proposed, including controlling the grid voltage of the wind farm to a given value, minimizing the total reactive power emitted by the wind farm, balancing reactive power output among multiple sets of SVGs in the wind farm and among multiple wind turbines, and prioritizing the regulation of SVGs. The model was solved using sequential linear programming, and the optimized output of reactive power such as SVG and wind turbines was obtained. The simulation verified the effectiveness of the model and strategy proposed in this article, which can balance steady-state reactive voltage control while also preventing the action of wind turbine fault ride through under significant and rapid changes in wind power output."

This paper presents a novel navigation framework leveraging a multi-camera system deployed in the environment to enable holistic environmental perception and robust robot navigation. The framework introduces a Generalized Multi-View Detection (GMVD) algorithm with learnable adaptive projection and dynamic view fusion, which uses markers to assist in robot localization. The navigation layer integrates an improved A* algorithm with a hierarchical strategy combining speed barriers and dynamic window approaches to achieve collision-free path planning. Real-world experiments comparing the proposed method with previous crowd navigation algorithms demonstrate that it significantly enhances the robot's navigation performance, generating obstacle-free paths for safe and efficient navigation in crowded scenarios."

Advances in port automation technology have driven the automated transformation of portal cranes, while 3D reconstruction technology serves as the core for intelligent grabbing operations, with its accuracy directly affecting the positioning of grabs and the reliability of obstacle avoidance control. Multi-line LiDAR is the primary tool for constructing 3D point cloud models, yet it faces challenges from various interference factors. Traditional registration algorithms exhibit limited adaptability to sparse point clouds, whereas deep learning methods enhance robustness and accuracy by automatically extracting deep-level features.

Traditional scheduling approaches such as round-robin or static prioritization lack adaptability under dynamic edge workloads. In this study, we propose a fuzzy logic-based task scheduling framework tailored for AI-enabled IoT edge devices, where sensor fusion, image processing, and alert generation occur concurrently. Our method integrates a fuzzy inference engine to dynamically assign task priorities based on multidimensional inputs including task urgency, execution load, and remaining power budget. This scheduler is embedded into an optimized round-robin loop that minimizes context-switching overhead while retaining responsiveness to mission-critical events such as anomaly detection or traffic violations. Mathematical modeling of fuzzy rule design is presented along with evaluation over a simulated STM32-based edge node, where AI-based frame analysis, temperature sensing, and communication payloads are scheduled adaptively. Experimental results show a 17.5% reduction in average latency and a 22.3% improvement in task success rate under fluctuating workloads, compared to baseline approaches. The proposed fuzzy scheduler significantly enhances decision intelligence and responsiveness in communication-intensive edge environments. This work contributes to the development of intelligent scheduling layers for next-generation IoT, vehicular, and AI-driven embedded systems."

However, existing machine learning diagnostic methods are unable to specifically extract current fault features. To solve this issue, an improved one-dimensional residual shrinkage network algorithm is proposed to diagnose inter-turn short circuit and permanent magnet demagnetization faults. Specifically, the threshold-fitting network module is first designed to extract three-phase current fault features. This allows it to automatically adjust the threshold size according to current amplitude, ensuring effective extraction of fault features and achieving data compression. Additionally, a shrinkage module is embedded within the convolutional residual network to suppress noise, aiding in enhancing fault diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method is tested based on electromechanical actuator experimental platform. By comparing the proposed algorithm with the traditional convolutional network and residual network algorithms, it is verified that the proposed algorithm has stronger feature extraction capability and exhibits higher accuracy."

    "abstract": "High dv/dt of voltage source motor drive inverter can be problematic for machine winding insulation, create severe EMI problems and machine bearing current issues. To address these problems, the common solution is to add the LC sine filter, forming the LCL topology with the stator winding inductance, thereby generating machine-friendly stator voltage waveform which requires active damping control. Meanwhile, the mechanical load is flexibly connected to the rotor, constituting a spring-mass elastic drivetrain that can generate torsional vibrations during transient condition. In the LC-filtered motor drive with mass-spring-mass system, both electrical and mechanical resonances coexist. This paper proposes the hybrid active damping scheme for such system. On this basis, hybrid active-damping algorithms are incorporated into the motor drive field-oriented control (FOC) framework, and the stabilities of both the electrical and the mechanical subsystems are analyzed. Furthermore, it proves that the LCL current control loop can be represented as a pure delay element, and demonstrates that speed-difference feedback active damping is equivalent to a virtual damping and a virtual stiffness, thereby providing a design guideline for oscillation suppressing of both electrical and mechanical resonances within a unified framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulations."

A stator magnetic motive force (MMF) model is established using a complex phasor approach, enabling accurate representation under complex winding arrangements. For the rotor, a boundary element method (BEM) is developed to precisely model the rotor pole geometry and calculate both the MMF and air-gap permeance spectra. On the stator side, the Schwarz–Christoffel conformal mapping is employed to characterize the slot geometry and derive the harmonic components of air-gap permeance. Additionally, the influence of the damper winding is quantified through an equivalent asynchronous induction circuit model, improving the accuracy of harmonic MMF estimation. The synthesized air-gap flux density is used to derive electromagnetic force waves via Maxwell stress analysis. Comparisons with finite element analysis (FEA) results confirm the method’s accuracy. Furthermore, the natural frequencies and vibration responses of the hydro-generator are calculated analytically and validated against measurements from a large-scale machine, demonstrating strong agreement and practical applicability."

The spline involved can be obtained by using a linear combination of several shifted B-splines of the same degree. The spatial and frequency domain comparison demonstrates its superior local support and frequency domain performance. In addition, a number of examples are involved in geometric modeling and digital image processing, compared with a few conventional methods. As shown in this paper, the cubic cardinal spline is an alternative choice instead of the cubic B-spline in the interpolation procedure in order to avoid solving the system of equations over and over again."

    "abstract": "The telecommunication industry in Malaysia plays a pivotal role in providing essential Internet and communication services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are increasingly adopting on Fibre Distribution Panels (FDPs) to deliver high-speed Internet to homes and businesses. Each new FDP installation requires an assessment to ensure safety and readiness of these setups. However, current methods rely on manual measurements, making the process inefficient and resource-intensive. While automated safety assessment systems are common in other industries, their application in the telecom sector remains largely unexplored. This study addresses the hap by introducing a computer vision-based approach to automate the safety distance assessment for FDP installations. With deep learning models, the system detects components and applies low-level image processing, the Line-Line intersection algorithm and Euclidean Distance to extract object width in pixel units. The system then checks for violations by determining whether other components violates the minimum required spacing set by the company. Experimental results using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 0.6 accuracy in component width retrieval at almost 12s per installation. Our overall installation quality assessment error rate is less than 0.35, mostly owing to object detection errors in identifying essential components. The system also cuts assessments time in half compared to traditional methods. This research enhances efficiency safety and service quality in the telecom industry, offering a scalable solution for reliable and timely FDP installation inspections."

    "abstract": "The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced, they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy. Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's diversity, a WBF approach using a ‘max’ confidence scoring strategy achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving accuracy metrics of ensembles."

This paper adopted the Level A and AA standards to ensure access for visually impaired students. Evaluation methods combined automated tools (WAVE) with manual checks of key pages, including Homepage, Course, Assignment, and Examination functions. Findings showed that the University-LMS posed the most accessibility challenges, notably missing alternative text, weak keyboard navigation, and low color contrast. In contrast, the University's Official Website nearly met all AA standards and served as a reliable benchmark. An online survey was conducted with 18 participants (four lecturers, two teaching assistants, and twelve visually impaired students) to confirm the evaluation results and gather feedback based on real-world usage. Survey responses reinforced experimental findings, highlighting LMS issues such as unclear navigation, missing form labels, and insufficient link descriptions. These barriers created greater difficulties for visually impaired users than the University's Website, which was more compliant with WCAG standards. Although limited in scope, the study underscores the pressing need to improve LMS accessibility. It suggests expanding future research to include a broader range of users, higher WCAG levels, and more inclusive design guidelines."

Therefore, in the process of allocating computing resources on the cloud platform, the limited cloud computing resources can be fully utilized, reducing the task completion time. It can efficiently manage and schedule computing resources, avoiding the high latency and network congestion problems that exist in the cloud control center when handling high-concurrency computing tasks."

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis of implicit sentiment in hotel reviews is quite challenging, as no explicit opinion words are present, so the model has to rely on context to determine the sentiment of the text. The research is about recognizing the implicit sentiment of the mentioned hotel aspects, i.e., staff service, cleanliness, value for money, and location, four critical areas of a hotel. To examine embedding representations, we have taken Word2Vec with TF-IDF, SciBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet as examples and combined them with six different machine learning and deep learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and CNN, etc. The performance was measured by using 10-fold cross-validation, and the evaluation metrics were F1-score, Accuracy, MCC, and AUC. The results show that embeddings derived from transformer-based models, especially RoBERTa and BERT, are more consistently better than those from classical methods, not only they achieve higher predictive stability but also are more robust when dealing with implicit sentiment. The best performance among non-neural methods was achieved by Word2Vec with TF-IDF, but the result was less stable. The evidence suggests that the deployment of contextualized embeddings is a very efficient way of capturing the subtle linguistic patterns that are required in an implicit sentiment field of research. This paper is a significant step forward for the romance of sentiment analysis in the hotel domain and opens up the field to reliable customer feedback systems development."

This is because as the size of MOSFET reduces decade by decade, to achieve better speed and lower power, and currently moving towards the nanometer regime, it has led to the limitation of the performance of MOSFET and faced a few bottlenecks. Therefore, TFET, which works on the principle of the tunnelling phenomenon, has been proposed as one of the devices to replace MOSFET, which works on the principle of thermionic emission that limits the device's sub-threshold swing to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$60 \\text{mV} /$</tex> decade.

In the sparse reconstruction process, the measured raw BGS matrix is treated as a noisy image, which can be represented as a linear combination of sparse basis and reconstructed by iteratively solving the optimal sparse coefficients. During the iterative operation, the random noise is suppressed as residuals and hence enhance the SNR. The basic principle, flow chart and solving algorithm are presented and further verified by numerical simulation. In the experiments, the temperature sensing is implemented by BOTDR to evaluate the denoising performance of BGS sparse reconstruction over 24.14 km fiber with 3m spatial resolution. Under 65°C, the fluctuation range and the root mean square error (RMSE) in the heating region are reduced from 13.9 MHz to 5 MHz and from 5.47 MHz to 1.65 MHz, respectively, with only 200 average counts. According to the calculation of distance-window RMSE, the SNR enhancement of 6.19 dB at the fiber end is achieved. Both simulation and experimental results show good performance in noise suppression."

    "abstract": "The detection of underwater targets is severely affected by the non-uniform spatial characteristics of marine environmental noise. Additionally, the presence of both natural and anthropogenic acoustic sources, including shipping traffic, marine life, and geological activity, further complicates the underwater acoustic landscape. Addressing these challenges requires advanced underwater sensors and robust signal processing techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system combined with a broadband generalized sparse covariance-fitting framework for underwater target direction sensing, particularly focusing on robustness against non-uniform noise. The DAS system incorporates a newly developed spiral-sensitized optical cable, which significantly improves sensitivity compared to conventional submarine cables. This innovative design enables the system to capture acoustic signals with greater precision. Notably, the sensitivity of the spiral-wound sensitized cable is around - 145.69 dB <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">re</i>:1rad/(μPa · m), as measured inside the standing-wave tube. Employing simulations, we assess the performance of the algorithm across diverse noise levels and target configurations, consistently revealing higher accuracy and reduced background noise compared to conventional beamforming techniques and other sparse techniques. In a controlled pool experiment, the correlation coefficient between waveforms acquired by the DAS system and a standard hydrophone reached 0.973, indicating high fidelity in signal capture. Moreover, during a lake field experiment, the DAS system equipped with a sensitized optical cable was deployed on the lakebed to consistently track a non-cooperative speedboat. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical scenarios involving complex, non-uniform noise environments."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how the integration strategy of infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) brightness temperatures (TBs) influences precipitation forecasting within an all-sky radiance data assimilation (DA) framework using a three-dimensional variational method. To improve heavy rainfall forecasts over Korea, we propose an asynchronous assimilation approach in which, when both IR and MW observations are available, only MW TBs are assimilated, and IR TBs are intentionally excluded to reduce redundancy and potential inconsistencies in cloud representation. The case study, focusing on a heavy precipitation event over the Korean Peninsula, employs IR TBs from the Himawari Imager (AHI) on Himawari-8 and MW TB from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) aboard the Global Change Observing Mission (GCOM-W). For comparison, two conventional synchronous strategies are conducted as baselines: one integrating clear-sky IR with all-sky MW, and the other integrating all-sky IR with all-sky MW. Results show that the asynchronous approach achieves the best balance between upper-level solid and lower-level liquid hydrometeors, leading to the most accurate precipitation forecasts. In contrast, with synchronous approaches, the all-sky IR with MW strategy enhances upper-level clouds but reduces low-level moisture, potentially resulting in localized heavy rainfall. Meanwhile, the clear-sky IR with MW approach underestimates upper-level cloud structures, which contributes to underestimation of stratiform rainfall. These findings highlight the importance of optimally designed IR–MW integration strategies for this specific heavy precipitation event and provide insights for future improvements in satellite-based precipitation assimilation systems."

    "abstract": "With the advent of Deep Learning, artificial neural networks have become the standard for classification and prediction tasks. They are now among the most popular and widely used machine learning models in various fields, including education and finance, among others. This trend is further driven by the development of technologies and architectures based on classical Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer models.The term \"Deep\" refers to the use of multiple sequential layers, which allows to perform several transformations of the input data. This approach helps to extract relevant hierarchical knowledge, allowing the model to deliver better results in its target tasks. According to the Universal Approximation Theorem, a sufficiently large ANN composed of a single layer can approximate any mathematical function. However, in practice, it is commonly more effective to distribute network complexity across multiple layers. In this paper the not-so-discussed topic of comparing the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which consist of multiple layers, versus Shallow Neural Networks (SNNs) composed of only a single layer, while keeping the number of parameters constant across different datasets is addressed. Moreover a discussion of the theoretical and mathematical reasons regarding why one type or ANN may outperform the other in terms of generalization is presented."

    "abstract": "Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful non-destructive analytical technique increasingly vital for battery state monitoring. However, constructing its Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) is a complex task that has traditionally depended on expert experience. Current automated approaches often frame this as a classification problem, which requires pre-training on large-scale datasets and limits their generalization ability to pre-defined topologies, thus failing to handle unknown structures in practical applications. To address this bottleneck, we propose Auto-EIS, a framework for automated ECM discovery based on deep reinforcement learning. The framework requires no extensive pre-training and can autonomously explore the optimal circuit topology as well as its precise parameters directly from a single impedance measurement. Our method was validated on typical ECMs, including those with Warburg and CPE elements. In all tests, Auto-EIS can correctly identify the circuit topology while achieving near-perfect parameter fits, evidenced by extremely low chi-squared error on the order of 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−4</sup>. Moreover, a test on the real-world battery dataset where model parameters vary across the entire State of Charge (SOC) range shows that Auto-EIS can achieve an average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of just 1.55% across all key parameters. Auto-EIS replaces the traditional, manual ECM construction with a fully automated process, thereby paving the way for large-scale electrochemical data analysis and online model updating in Battery Management Systems (BMS) during long-term operation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to defining and validating the reliability of automotive components through detailed usage definition. Usage definition involves assessing the stresses that a system is expected to encounter throughout its lifetime by evaluating probable user behaviors and environmental conditions. High-level system requirements are established, dictating reliability targets, such as less than 10% failure probability at the end of life, and these must be translated into suitable targets for the development and validation teams. The methodology includes the consideration of the usage definition as a distribution, rather than a single value, and the resultant expected reliability validation impact that results.The novelty of this approach lies in enabling validation results to be considered as a failure probability versus expected damage accumulation. By evaluating the failure probability and usage probability distributions through convolution, a cumulative failure distribution is obtained. This distribution is compared to reliability targets to ensure compliance. The methodology supports an agile validation process, allowing for tailored validation strategies that enhance validation accuracy while reducing costs.The results demonstrate that the component meets reliability targets throughout its operational life, with cumulative failure distributions remaining below acceptable thresholds. The approach also considers extreme users with an appropriate level of rarity, reducing conservatism and promoting efficient resource use. The conclusions highlight the benefits of this methodology in providing a realistic and comprehensive understanding of component reliability, supporting robust and reliable automotive component development."

    "abstract": "This study presents an advanced framework for optimal energy management in a smart microgrid incorporating diverse energy sources, electric vehicles (EVs), and thermal storage. The objective is to minimize operational costs through a two-stage stochastic programming approach that accounts for uncertainties in key parameters such as electricity price, load demand, wind speed, and solar irradiance. To enhance demand-side efficiency, a combination of price-based and incentive-based demand response programs is implemented, analyzing their impact on load profile smoothing and reducing dependence on the upstream grid. EVs function as dual-purpose assets within the system, serving as both electricity consumers and energy storage units capable of injecting power into the grid, thereby improving microgrid operational flexibility. Uncertainty modeling is performed using scenario generation through probability distribution discretization, followed by scenario reduction via mixed-integer linear programming. The proposed model is implemented and solved in the GAMS software environment, and the obtained results indicate that integrating EVs and demand response programs significantly reduces operational costs while enhancing grid stability and sustainability."

    "abstract": "Given the climate change crisis, power grids are transitioning towards greater sustainability through distributed energy resources (DERs), energy storage systems, and smart loads. Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) emerge as a novel solution, enabling the flexible management of DERs, maintaining grid balance by controlling both generation and consumption. This study presents a stochastic scheduling model for a VPP, comprising conventional generators (CG), photovoltaic panels (PV), wind turbines (WT), CHP systems, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and boilers. The model incorporates uncertainties related to electrical and thermal loads, wind speed, solar irradiation, and market prices. Random scenarios are generated using a Monte Carlo method and reduced with a K-means clustering algorithm. Additionally, Demand Side Management (DSM) programs are employed to optimize VPP performance. The model is implemented on a standard IEEE 33-bus network and solved using the CPLEX solver in the GAMS environment. Simulation results indicate a 24% discrepancy between revenues and costs, yielding a net profit of 1659.16 $. Furthermore, electrical revenue increased by 60% compared to thermal revenue, and electricity sales were 61.4% higher than the cost of purchasing from the upstream grid. These findings demonstrate that the proposed model can enhance the net profit of the Virtual Power Plant over a 24-hour period."

This method integrates various flexibility resources, including distributed generation (source side), transferable/interruptible loads (load side), and energy storage (storage side), into the operation optimization model of multi-microgrids. It not only focuses on the scheduling of a single type of resource but also comprehensively considers their synergistic effects in peak shaving, fluctuation smoothing, reducing wind curtailment, and ensuring load supply. This approach achieves a transition from “single microgrid internal optimization” to “interaction among multiple microgrids and coordinated optimization of multiple types of resources.” The method is validated using a case study of three interconnected microgrid systems, and the results demonstrate improved overall system economy and energy utilization efficiency."

In this context, train control and management systems play a central role, and their software must undergo rigorous validation. Alstom Rail Sweden AB employs a digital twin infrastructure to simulate and validate train control and management systems software. While this setup significantly improves system-level testing, the root cause analysis of test failures remains a manual and time-consuming bottleneck.This study explores the potential of large language models to automate root cause analysis by interpreting execution logs generated during digital twin-based testing. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art large language models, Aion-1.0, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V3 0324, Mistral Small 3.1 24B, GPT o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, and QwB 32B, using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting to assess their ability to reason about fault patterns in real-world industrial test execution logs. The logs, sourced from Alstom’s digital twin-based testing environment, capture complex operational behaviour typical of embedded, safety-critical systems.Our results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental achieved the best performance with 66.7% accuracy and strong reasoning quality in this domain, contributing to the future research agenda to improve the accuracy prediction."

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering models from source code is a crucial activity for facilitating program comprehension and supporting software modernization. Existing reverse engineering tools are typically tailored to specific programming languages and often lack the flexibility to be easily extended or adapted to others. While sophisticated support exists for some languages such as Java, many other languages remain poorly supported. Motivated by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in code understanding and translation tasks across heterogeneous programming languages, we aim to explore whether LLMs can mitigate this imbalance. We envision LLMs to easily transfer reverse engineering capabilities between programming languages once understanding the reverse engineering task. As step towards this vision, this paper presents an experiment in which we finetuned CodeT5, an LLM pretrained on code translation tasks, on the task of generating sequence diagrams from Java methods. We systematically evaluate its generalization capabilities by applying the finetuned model to generate sequence diagrams for Python methods. Our quantitative results are promising but not without limitations. The finetuned model achieves almost perfect accuracy on Java methods. The transfer performance for Python input reaches approximately 80% accuracy, consistently measured across different evaluation metrics. In a qualitative analysis, we find that the good results stem from similar Java and Python code structures but the model fails, for instance to transfer keywords. Building on our experimental infrastructure and datasets, we lay the groundwork for future research on examining the generalization capabilities."

Onchip cache hierarchy and NoC play big roles to break “memory wall”. However, large data storage capacity and high data bandwidth cannot be met easily by conventional memory techniques such as SRAM due to the high leakage power and large area overhead. To deal with these problems, applying emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) for on-chip cache and NoC is a promising approach. This paper reviews optimization schemes for NVMbased on-chip cache hierarchy and NoC router. We categorize the schemes according to their optimization objectives to highlight their strengths and weaknesses in the context of motivating background. We expect that this survey may help researchers get deeper insights into the potential of applying NVM in next generation high performance computing systems."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution, but extracting consistent signals across large, diverse datasets remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a foundation model trained on a harmonized compendium of 1.7 million single cells from AD and control brains. Built on a transformer-based generative architecture and extended with a curated gene vocabulary, our model achieves 83 % accuracy in distinguishing AD from control cells and 83 % accuracy in predicting Braak stage, substantially outperforming nonpretrained baselines. Beyond classification, our model supports unsupervised extraction of biologically meaningful gene clusters, that may reveal transcriptional modules related to AD. These results demonstrate that foundation models can unlock scalable, interpretable frameworks for modelling neurodegeneration and support systematic hypothesis generation in AD research."

However, as engineers from different domains contribute asynchronously to a single knowledge model, they often introduce inconsistencies that remain unnoticed. Version control systems, which are used to synchronize changes to such models, are however, content agnostic and, therefore, are not able to check semantic relations within a model. We introduce a framework designed to also maintain the semantic consistency of CDKM instances during concurrent, distributed editing. It operates in environments where engineers use version control systems to manage shared ontological models across interdisciplinary teams. This way, engineers can address problems faster and notice inconsistencies earlier by embedding this validation and correction process into their integration workflow."

    "abstract": "In Model-Based Engineering (MBE), practitioners frequently face the challenge of selecting appropriate tools from a large number of options. This requires both deep domainspecific knowledge and technical expertise. LLM-based agents are software components that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously select and apply software tools to perform specific tasks. Although LLMs have already been applied to support various MBE activities, considering LLMbased agents to autonomously assist users of MBE tools remains underexplored. This is particularly challenging in industrial MBE environments where only medium-sized on-premise LLMs can be used due to company policies related to security or data privacy (for instance). To investigate the potential of LLM-based agents for MBE, we start with model-to-model transformation as a core MBE technique. Currently, off-the-shelf agents such as Microsoft Copilot can invoke a transformation engine (e.g., ATL) when the task is explicitly described. However, these agents struggle to select the correct transformation when they only have limited contextual information, especially when coupled with medium-size LLMs. To overcome this, we propose an approach based on complementary mechanisms. First, we build a model transformation server and an LLM agent with dedicated tools for each transformation available on the server. Second, to enable the agent to efficiently select transformations, we rely on a tool retrieval technique based on a tool relevance score computed by an LLM. We evaluate our LLM agent on a transformation dataset we also contribute to the community. Our comparative study shows that the newly proposed LLM agent responds more accurately to user instructions."

    "abstract": "As Machine Learning (ML) models are integrated into complex systems, their role in safety-critical scenarios and human-in-the-loop environments becomes increasingly significant. These scenarios require that the ML model be trustworthy and predictable. However, ML models are often considered black boxes, making them difficult to validate. As a result, ensuring system safety becomes considerably more difficult. In this paper, we propose the validity frame concept to manage the ML lifecycle and improve trust in the model. Within the frame, we capture key factors that influence a ML model’s performance throughout its lifecycle, from data collection and training to model deployment. These factors are explicitly linked back to the model requirements to ensure traceability. We present this approach using a practical case study involving anomaly detection in a Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor. This demonstrates how the validity frame enables lifecycle monitoring and informed design decisions. We discuss the viability of this approach, its limitations, and provide ideas for future work."

    "abstract": "The phase out of conventional synchronous generators (SGs) and the vigorous development of renewable energy sources (RESs) are indisputably leading to a significant reduction in the inertia of power grids, blowing a hole in frequency security and stability. To address this issue, various fast-acting resources such as battery energy systems (BESS) are being discussed worldwide. Accurate quantifying the relative effectiveness of these resources in arresting frequency decline to conventional methods is, therefore, of great significance to securely operate low-inertia power systems (LIPS). To do so, an analytical model of the equivalent frequency-containment performance ratio (EFCPR) is proposed for heterogeneous resources having different response characteristics. Furthermore, two Sigmoid-function-based approaches are also proposed to extend the EFCPR model to aggregated resources, and a more general scenario taking delivery time instant of instantaneous response BESS into account. Numerical results on the Texas test case and the Great Britain power grids with real operation data (from September 2023 to December 2024) collected from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) website validate the EFCPR model and penetrate many of the parameters' impacts."

The proposed antenna structure uses an orthogonal dual-mode rectangular SIW cavity as the common resonant cavity, with the feeding position located inside the cavity. The TE120 and TE210 modes in the common cavity are coupled to four radiation cavities through coupling windows. Mixed electromagnetic coupling occurs between the rectangular SIW cavity and a circular patch cavity by introducing a radiation null at the high-impedance side of the dual-band operation. Additionally, nine metallized vias are strategically placed to create another radiation null at the low-impedance side. To improve gain performance, a new configuration is implemented by adding a second layer of copper sheet supported by metal posts on the first metal surface. Experimental results show that a gain of 11.3 dBi with a -3 dB bandwidth of 6% in the low-frequency band and a gain of 12 dBi with a -3 dB bandwidth of 6.8% in the high-frequency band can be achieved. Furthermore, the cross-polarization levels remain below -40 dB on both the E-plane and H-plane throughout the dual-passbands."

    "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of Golden Tides (Sargassum Harmful Algal Blooms) is critical for preventing and mitigating marine ecological disasters. Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods employ image-level labels to derive pixel-level predictions. While they considerably reduce annotation costs and accelerate deployment compared to fully supervised approaches, they still encounter several challenges: Golden Tide occurs as irregular floating patches at sea and class activation maps (CAMs) focus only on the most discriminative regions, many discrete targets are overlooked and pseudo-labels remain incomplete. Moreover, complex marine backgrounds distract model attention and introduce semantic noise, reducing pseudo-label reliability and hindering detection accuracy from meeting practical requirements. We propose MPECAM, a multi-prototype-enhanced weakly supervised framework for Golden Tide detection, which consists of three main components: (i) Multi-Prototype Fusion (MPF) strategy and Multi-Prototype Re-Activation (MPRA) module, which dynamically maintain a prototype bank and reweight feature maps to activate weak-response regions, thereby enhancing completeness for irregular targets; (ii) Inter-Prototype Contrastive Constraint (IC2) module, which employs a foreground-global-background triplet contrastive loss to decoupling Golden Tide feature from seawater features, suppress semantic confusion, and refine pseudo-label purity; (iii) a self-supervised consistency mechanism, which leverages the refined CAM as supervision to reintegrate structurally complete pseudo-label knowledge back into the backbone, enabling joint optimization of the modules. Experimental results on hybrid sensor remote sensing imagery covering the Yellow and East China Seas demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance (59.25% mIoU and 74.41% F1-score), providing reliable segmentation of Golden Tide regions and offering a scalable solution for marine HAB agile monitoring."

    "abstract": "Radar jamming identification is a key technology in radar anti-jamming systems, providing a foundation for intelligent countermeasure decision-making. To address the limitations in multi domain feature fusion of radar jamming signals, this paper proposes a method based on Multi-Domain Fusion for Semantic Graph Reasoning (SGR-MDF). A dual-domain feature interaction network is designed to enable adaptive complementarity and joint enhancement of time- and frequency-domain features. Multi-level features from the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains are then fused to improve signal representation. A graph convolutional classifier is introduced to model both comprehensive and core semantic relationships among jamming types, enhancing classification performance. Experimental results on a dataset comprising 50 jamming types demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.68% at a jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) of 0 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and exhibiting strong robustness under low-JNR conditions."

Moreover, in order to reduce the probe's profile, the ground planes and horizontal ground planes are together printed on the outer layers. A near-field test system with a standard 50 Ω microstrip line is applied to characterize the manufactured magnetic probe. The measured results demonstrate that the transmission coefficients of the probe exceed -46.7 dB in the x-direction across the 3–12 GHz band and are greater than -50 dB in the y-direction from 3.1 to 12 GHz. Therefore, the proposed magnetic probe not only has a wide working bandwidth but also enables dual-component magnetic-field measurement."

This paper describes a comprehensive face and person detection system based on YOLOv5 for person detection and OpenCV’s deep learning models for frontal and profile face detection. The proposed system receives video footage, performs detection, and tracks targets throughout the frames while measuring performance indicators such as frame per second (FPS), CPU, and memory consumption. In contrast to traditional methods, multiple detection approaches were applied, which makes the system more accurate and robust in dynamic conditions. The full-scale implementation validation of the system was performed using real-life video footage where finding the balance among the models’ accuracy, efficiency, and real-time processing speed posed challenges. This approach designs a framework based on the requirements of real-time systems which can be improved by integrating multi-angle face recognition, optimizing on edge devices, and tailoring to specific domains.

To solve this problem, this study developed three deep learning models (CNN, DenseNet201, and UNet) to classify skin lesions from dermoscopic images. Advanced techniques such as attention modules (SE, CBAM), data augmentation (Mixup), and explainable AI (Grad-CAM) were implemented to increase model accuracy and interpretability. Among these, the UNet model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 95%, followed by DenseNet201 (93%) and CNN (90%). Additionally, Grad-CAM demostrates clear visual explanations for the models’ decisions, improving clinical trust.

Conventional dipole antennas show a decrease in efficiency and gain when placed near metal surfaces. To address this problem, this study investigates the design of co-current bifilar helical antennas specifically optimized for near-metal RFID applications. The bifilar configuration, using co-current excitation, improves the magnetic near-field strength while simultaneously stabilizing the input impedance to achieve a predominantly real value with minimal reactance. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations in FEKO are used to evaluate the bifilar helical antenna’s performance at variable distances from metallic plates, demonstrating substantial improvements in gain, magnetic field distribution, and impedance stability compared to conventional single helices. The proposed design indicates a 1.28 dBi gain, over the 0.6 dBi achieved by single helical counterparts. This study highlights the significance of using bifilar structures to alleviate the unfavorable effects of metal proximity, making the antenna highly suitable for robust, reliable RFID operation in metal-rich environments. The results are expected to provide more efficient industrial tracking, logistics, and asset management systems where metallic interference is inevitable."

Financial transactions, in particular, rely on the assumption that payments are legitimate, which makes banknote authentication an essential use case. Banknotes incorporate several security features, and the applied printing technique itself can be leveraged for authentication. Specifically, Intaglio printing results in fine line work and microstructures that can be analyzed and distinguished by spatial frequency analysis, e. g. the wavelet packet transform. By evaluating statistical moments of wavelet coefficient histograms, fast and reliable authentication is achieved. This paper adapts the AdvGAN framework for the context of wavelet-based banknote authentication. By proposing a customized loss function that constrains the feature space, highly effective yet subtle adversarial examples are generated. These perturbations deceive the authentication system, causing it to classify forgeries as genuine banknotes and genuine ones as forgeries.

This paper addresses a Slice Admission Control (SAC) self-optimisation problem under persistent gNodeB (gNB) congestion, prioritising Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) requests while simultaneously accommodating Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) services. We described how SLA-driven reward shaping could add context awareness for SAC in a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), and evaluated three distinct Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, namely Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Rainbow. The DRL methods were independently evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations within our fully softwarised gNB environment with randomised URLLC and eMBB traffic. The results demonstrated that all DRL-driven SAC methods could effectively increase URLLC SLA satisfaction to approximately 99.5 percent within 100 training episodes, representing a 17 percent improvement over contextless SAC. Rainbow offers the fastest convergence, while A2C offers more stable long-term generalisation, and DQN strikes a balance between optimisation and computational efficiency. These findings provide actionable insights for evaluating DRL-driven SAC in more dynamic Open RAN-based 5G network slicing frameworks."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a knowledge-guided multi-modal neural network (KMNet) for non-invasive HER2 subtyping by integrating clinical data and ultrasound images. KMNet introduces a Graph-based Clinical Feature encoder (GCF), which constructs a causal graph among clinical indicators based on medical knowledge and extracts high-order feature relationships via the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Meanwhile, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based hybrid image encoder (CVUIF) captures both local details (calcifications and blood flow) and global dependencies between intra- and peritumoral regions. In addition, the Reduced Dimensional Fusion (RDF) module integrates key information from clinical graph features, ultrasound image features, and structured clinical data to construct a unified multi-modal representation for downstream HER2 subtyping task. Experiments were conducted on the private datasets (HER2USC) and the public datasets (BCW, BCa and SIIM-ISIC). Experimental results demonstrate that KMNet outperformed other reported state-ofthe- art multi-modal algorithms in HER2 subtyping task, offering strong potential for clinical decision support in breast cancer treatment."

    "abstract": "This paper details the basic situation of reentered Starlink satellites and analyzes the reasons for the surge in the number of Starlink satellite reentries since 2024 from the perspectives of satellite lifespan, operational failures, solar activities, and geomagnetic storms. There are three main reasons: First, the lifespan of Starlink satellites is shorter than expected, and Starlink V1.0 has entered the end of its service life, which is the primary reason for the increase in reentries. Second, operational failures of Starlink and SpaceX’s active release of orbital slots to supplement second-generation Starlink satellites are important reasons for the rising number of reentries. Third, intense solar activities and frequent geomagnetic storms have caused some satellites to be forced to deorbit due to abnormal orbits and shortened the reentry time of Starlink satellites, serving as a key superimposed factor for the growth in reentries. Therefore, the surge in Starlink satellite reentries since 2024 is the result of the superposition of multiple factors."

    "abstract": "With the development of unmanned systems, the cross-link coupling between individual drones and swarms has become increasingly strong, making the evaluation of the contribution rate of individual equipment to the entire system more critical. This paper first constructs a performance index system for UAV swarms. Using the entropy weight method, weights are calculated for five performance parameters, calculating and screening out the core indicators: maximum range $(27 \\%)$, payload $(23 \\%)$, and cruising speed $(20 \\%)$.Taking the typical UAV rescue scenario constructed by NetLogo simulation as an example, based on 20 sets of simulation samples (100 experiments in each group), Random Forest(RF), Extreme Learning Machine(ELM), BP neural network(BP-NN) and support vector regression (SVR) models are established to comprehensively predict the contribution rate of UAV and verify its accuracy.Among them, the SVR model demonstrates the best fitting performance. The support vector regression model is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO). The kernel width parameter G and penalty parameter C of SVR are optimized globally, and the SVR model optimized by QPSO shows better performance. The experimental results show that the correlation coefficient R2 of the QPSO-SVR model is 0.9984, which is $10.7 \\%$ higher than that of the traditional SVR, and the root mean square error RMSE is reduced to 0.0015.The results indicate that this method can provide scientific guidance for calculating the system contribution rate in drone swarm rescue mission scenarios.However, the research limitation is that this paper is based on small-scale simulation data, and needs to be extended to actual scenarios or large sample situations in the future."

    "abstract": "Load forecasting in distribution networks is essential for ensuring system reliability, optimizing operational scheduling and integration of renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, accurate forecasting remains challenging due to complex long-term temporal dependencies, spatial correlations constrained by the physical topology and the growing demand for computational efficiency. To address these issues, STSegRNN, a lightweight spatio-temporal load forecasting model is proposed. In the spatial dimension, Chebyshev Graph Convolutional Networks restrict computations to K-hop neighbors rather than considering all nodes in the graph. A node-level attention mechanism is further integrated to adaptively weigh the influence of each node based on its learned importance, independent of neighborhood structure. For temporal modeling, Segmented Recurrent Neural Networks (SegRNN) divide the input sequence into fixed-length segments, effectively reducing training overhead while preserving local temporal patterns. Contextual dependencies across segments are established through a subsequent attention mechanism, enhancing the model’s capacity to represent long-term temporal dependencies. The proposed method is validated on the SimBench datasets and the experimental results on real-world distributionnetwork load data demonstrate that STSegRNN achieves a significant reduction of 82.82% in trainable parameters, while maintaining prediction accuracy comparable to ASTGCN."

    "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) typically exhibit low inertia, and interconnecting them into a microgrid cluster (MGC) can enhance both the stability and economic efficiency of system operation. To accommodate the increased system scale, hierarchical distributed control strategies are widely adopted for MGC management. While distributed control inherently supports plug-and-play functionality, limited research has addressed how to minimize the system fluctuations caused by MG integration and removal. This paper proposes a soft plug-and-play mechanism based on dynamic droop coefficients. By gradually adjusting the droop coefficient, a smooth transition in MG output power is achieved, thereby avoiding abrupt grid connection and disconnection. Building on this mechanism, an improved hierarchical distributed control strategy is developed for MGC. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively mitigates the impact of microgrid plug-and-play on overall system stability."

In this study, the effect of hydrogen doping on pulverized coal combustor is investigated through numerical simulation, aiming to provide new ideas for carbon reduction strategies in coal-fired power plants. Six hydrogen doping ratios of 0 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 35 % and 40 % were set in the study, and the hydrogen distribution, furnace moisture and carbon dioxide emission were analyzed in depth. The results showed that when the hydrogen doping ratio was 0 %, the carbon dioxide mole fraction in the furnace was 17.48 %. with the increase of hydrogen doping ratio, the carbon dioxide emission decreased significantly, especially when the hydrogen doping ratio reached 30 %, the carbon dioxide mole fraction decreased to 13.15 %, which was a reduction of 4.33 %. However, potential trade-offs such as NOx emissions and flow field instability at high doping ratios require further experimental validation. Economic feasibility analysis indicates alkaline electrolysis hydrogen could reduce operational costs, though infrastructure modifications remain a challenge. In addition, hydrogen blending elevated the moisture content in the furnace and affected the airflow distribution through the water vapor generated by hydrogen combustion, resulting in the formation of a high-concentration hydrogen zone at the burner outlet. with the increase of hydrogen doping ratio, the effect of hydrogen from pulverized coal pyrolysis on the hydrogen content in the furnace gradually decreases. When the hydrogen doping ratio exceeds 30 %, the inhomogeneity of the flow field may negatively affect the combustion performance. Therefore, reasonable adjustment of the hydrogen doping ratio is considered to be an effective strategy for realizing the decarbonization of pulverized coal combustion, which opens up a new direction for the clean utilization of coal, and has significant application potential and innovative significance."

The study's core objectives are to develop a classification model and to employ Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide a transparent, interpretable rationale for its predictions. The methodology involved a multi-class classification task on a private dataset of 700 historical B2B IT sales records during the period 2020–2022. After a comprehensive data preprocessing, modeling and evaluation phase, which included 10-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning and a comparison of various algorithms, the research found that Gradient Boosting was the top-performing classifier with the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 76%, 76.3%, 75.5%, and 76.2% respectively. Crucially, the application of the Feature Importance method, a XAI technique, revealed that Budget in USD, Engagement Level, and Required Service Mobile Application were consistently the most influential features in predicting client potential. These insights provide valuable and data-driven business intelligence for sales strategies."

However, due to the imbalance in the number of fault samples, it is difficult to analyze the data, and existing fault diagnosis methods struggle to extract multi-level fault features. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Gaussian-Optimized Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (GO-SMOTE), which fits the underlying distribution of the original data using a Gaussian Mixture Model. This replaces traditional linear interpolation, avoiding the overlap problem between classes, and clears abnormal data through an editing nearest neighbor algorithm. Furthermore, to comprehensively capture the fault features of oil chromatograms, this paper proposes a Multi-Scale Cascade Convolutional Network (MSCCN), which uses residual convolutional layers and local self-attention to capture local fault information, while parallel global self-attention gathers global fault information, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the oil chromatogram's fault state. The method is experimentally analyzed using small sample data from a certain substation, and compared with similar technologies, demonstrating the accuracy and superiority of the proposed approach. Additionally, feature visualization is performed to highlight the advanced nature of the GO-SMOTE method."

Conventional ground stations for satellite communication typically require high power consumption and incur substantial construction costs. These factors make it challenging to build accessible ground stations for observing and exploring satellite communication principles, as they are primarily designed for industrial applications. These limitations can be overcome by implementing Long Range (LoRa) technology, which provides a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper proposes utilizing the TinyGS system and the LoRa32 V2.1_1.6 board, which enables satellite communication to be more user-friendly and accessible. A specific calculation was performed to design a quarter-wave dipole antenna that resonates at 433 MHz. The ground station received data from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites via LoRa, processed via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and made it available for further observation in TinyGS open system interface. Upon the activation of the ground station, it was observed that environmental factors, such as an open space with a direct sky view and no surrounding buildings, optimized telemetry data reception by reducing signal reflection and attenuation. A total of 371 telemetry signals were successfully received within one month of operation. The telemetry data obtained can be interpreted. However, it requires a special decoder from the satellite signal provider. The successful implementation of a LoRa ground station could transform remote data collection, making it more accessible and efficient."

This paper demonstrates the training of an AI model for 3D reconstruction from X-rays and its intended application to 3D surgical planning. The training process makes use of Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) - synthetic images that are close approximations to X-rays, with the advantages of more flexible augmentation possibilities and perfect alignment to CT (and the associated 3D ground truth). Reconstruction results are shown and compared to ground truth.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative robust control method to tackle state-dependent input saturation constraints in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional saturation, which utilizes a static constraint boundary for all operating situations, state-dependent saturation dynamically modifies its bounds in real-time according to system states. This process effectively diminishes conservatism and aligns more closely with the inherent physical laws of real-world systems. Nevertheless, the time-varying feasible input domain created by dynamic limitations poses considerable hurdles in computational demands and stability certification. To adress these challenges, this paper develops a robust controller utilizing diffeomorphism theory that explicitly delineate constraint properties, thereby guaranteeing practical stability (uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness) under state-dependent constraints, time-varying modeling uncertainties, and noise. Simulations on a turbofan engine model confirm the efficacy of the proposed State-dependent Constraint Robust Control (SCRC). Results indicate that SCRC attains a 14.3% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and a 0.62-second decrease in settling time relative to Sliding Mode Control (SMC). Notably, while SMC demonstrates constraint violations for 19.5% of the operational period, SCRC consistently complies with state-dependent constraints under all circumstances. These findings conclusively establish the potential of SCRC in improving control performance and strictly enforcing dynamic constraints."

    "abstract": "A Chinese character has multiple decomposition methods, which can be represented by breaking it down into units such as strokes and components, or further expressed as ideographic description sequences through structural symbols. However, when expanding to new characters, existing methods mostly rely on manual processing, and due to the existence of multiple decomposition methods, the description sequence generation of newly included or rare characters often consumes a large amount of time, resulting in delays in data updates and limiting database applications. Although existing automated models are able to generate description sequences from glyph images, most of them lack the ability to learn the spatial positions and structural relationships of components within a glyph, thus making predictions prone to errors when dealing with complex characters. To overcome these limitations, this study explores Transformer-based models and incorporates spatial information into both stroke and component datasets. The findings provide evidence that the integration of spatial information within the stroke dataset achieves the most favorable performance in generating structural description sequences."

    "abstract": "Different from wheeled robots, humanoid robots should have the ability to cross and step on obstacles, and in order to realize autonomous navigation of humanoid robots in three-dimensional (3D) environments, the robots must be able to achieve efficient path planning and collision-free gait generation in all kinds of 3D environments. This paper proposes a 3D environment navigation and real-time gait planning framework for humanoid robots based on traditional motion planning methods, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The framework adopts an ellipsoid approximation to characterize the swing leg motion envelope space for efficient collision detection. Within the 3D environment, a terrain adaptive mechanism is employed, wherein planar support analysis and local terrain complexity assessment are combined to enable differential filtering of dense RRT-generated path nodes. This filtered path planning is integrated with a gait controller to fully exploit the motion capabilities of the robot while enhancing planning efficiency. The challenge of humanoid robot navigation has been addressed by this framework, and its efficacy has been validated through experiments."

While radar– based biosignal monitoring offers the advantages of comfort and privacy, its reliability during motion remains limited. To address this, we build upon our previous work by extending a signal processing framework that employs non–negative matrix factorization (NMF) and template matching. Eleven participants were tested under a structured protocol involving static sitting and controlled body movements. Radar data were analyzed from multiple reflection points to extract micro–motions correlated with physiological signals. Temporal features were decomposed and matched to synthetic respiration and heart rate templates across defined frequency bands. Experimental results show strong correlation with ground truth signals, with heart rate detection achieving up to 100% accuracy under static conditions and over 80% during motion. Bland–Altman and correlation analyses further validate the method’s reliability. This approach offers promise for practical, privacy–preserving health monitoring, though future work is needed to extend measurement duration and enable real–time implementation."

Leveraging machine learning techniques, including fairness-aware contextual bandits and NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, the framework balances key performance indicators (KPIs) with equitable opportunity distribution across diverse user segments, particularly underrepresented groups. An explainable decision pipeline, using SHAP values and counterfactual fairness, ensures transparency and compliance with regulations like the EU Digital Markets Act. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate a 12% reduction in systemic bias with only a 3% KPI drop. This scalable, regulation-ready solution enhances stakeholder trust and monetization potential, offering a robust framework for sustainable platform expansion in dynamic, multi-sided ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Hydropower resources exhibit strong seasonality, with flood season inflows accounting for about 70% of the total annual volume. To achieve optimal allocation of water resources, it is necessary to rely on the regulatory reservoirs in each basin to conduct \"storage during wet seasons and replenishment during dry seasons\" adjustments, redistributing the natural inflows. This paper proposes a joint operation scheduling method for cascaded hydropower plants that takes into account the supply guarantee security and flood Prevention. Firstly, considering the supply guarantee security and flood Prevention, a joint operation optimal model for cascaded hydropower plants is developed, Then, an optimal scheduling method to control the concentrated drawdown of centralized drainage before flood is proposed. This method aims to regulate the extent of pre-flood water level drawdown while addressing the power supply and flood Prevention requirements of cascaded hydropower plants. Finally, through the simulation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yalong River Basin, the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling method is finally validated. The results indicate that reservoir water levels can be effectively regulated under different inflow conditions by the optimal scheme, water spillage can be reduced, power generation efficiency can be enhanced, and stable water supply can be ensured. This demonstrates that the method is scientifically rational and feasible in practical applications."

When the model evolves, it can become misaligned with its API implementation, which typically requires manual, costly, and error-prone realignment, highlighting the need for automated repair. This paper presents our ongoing work on an automated repair approach to resynchronize evolving YANG models with their API implementations, using a four-stage pipeline: (i) localize compatible-vs-breaking diffs between the current and updated models, (ii) enrich each diff record with contextual information, (iii) instantiate precise transformation rules for every change, and (iv) apply those rules to generate a repaired version of the code, complete with a reviewable change log for engineer validation. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we have developed an initial prototype-YANG-APR-that targets five common model evolution scenarios: datatype change, node rename, endpoint URL rename, endpoint removal, and endpoint addition. We illustrate the approach through two representative cases: a breaking datatype modification and a non-breaking endpoint addition. These early results show promising potential to facilitate model-implementation coevolution, providing a foundation for continued development and broader evaluation."

However, when flying straight through a thermal core, roll cues are weak, making it hard for RL agents to anticipate circling. This can delay thermal centering and waste potential energy gain. We propose adding pitching moment as an additional observation. Pitching moment reflects vertical airflow gradients along the fuselage, providing early cues of strong up-drafts. We design a deep RL agent with three-layer neural network and discrete bank angle actions. Simulations use a stationary Gaussian thermal model and glider dynamics. Results show that the pitchaugmented agent recognizes thermals earlier and begins circling sooner. Compared to baseline models, it gains up to $\\sim 8 \\%$ more altitude in head-on approaches and achieves better centering stability. This confirms that pitching moment sensing enhances autonomous soaring. Future work will explore moving thermals and real-world flight tests."

Our approach combines random oversampling of minority lithologies (e.g., coal and dolomite) with strategic undersampling of dominant classes, ensuring balanced representation while preserving critical geological patterns. Hyperparameter tuning via optimization further refines model performance, achieving an accuracy of 83.91% with a penalty score of -0.4087, demonstrating superior reliability, particularly for underrepresented facies. A comparative computational analysis confirms the efficiency of our framework, which outperforms complex models, such as GrowNet and Blender, as well as baselines, in both speed and scalability.

    "abstract": "One of the key aspects of modern agriculture is the detection of plant diseases. With the significant advancement of technology, one of the simplest and most cost-effective methods for assessing plant health is through image-based data. A common approach for analyzing such data involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of these networks, deploying them on edge devices is often challenging and costly. In this work, we propose a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a powerful teacher model based on ResNet-50 to a compact student model built upon ResNet-18. This framework adaptively regulates the strength of knowledge distillation based on simulated noise levels during training, improving robustness under diverse conditions without requiring explicit noise estimation at inference. Experiments conducted on the PlantDoc dataset demonstrate that our method improves the student model’s accuracy from 61.86% to 65.25%, which is 2.11% higher than the teacher model’s accuracy, while reducing the student model's size by 47.2 MB compared to the teacher. The proposed approach provides a practical solution for real-time and on-device plant disease diagnosis."

In this paper, we explore the relationship between CM and UX by developing a mapping between existing CM and UX ontologies. We propose CMUX Explorer, an ontology-driven assessment tool that enables tool builders to identify CM features with UX impact. The conversational front-end allows for natural-language interactions, which CMUX Explorer translates to SPARQL queries, executes them against the ontology, and returns ranked, interpretable recommendations to guide design decisions. Importantly, our approach supports continuous, semi-automated improvement of the ontology, leading to more precise recommendations over time. Through this work, we pave a path towards computer-aided design of UX-aware collaborative modeling tools."

    "abstract": "In today's world, marked by swift technological progress and the growing use and scale of software systems both in terms of data volume and number of users, the occurrence of software faults has become inevitable. Consequently, software fault prediction has gained significant importance for the early identification of faulty modules during the software development process. However, one of the key challenges in this domain is the class imbalance problem, where the number of faulty and non-faulty instances in software datasets is highly unequal. To address this issue, data oversampling techniques are commonly employed to balance the datasets. In this study, we investigate and compare the performance of three data oversampling methods on the BugHunter software fault dataset. The results indicate that using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data generation and oversampling is a more effective approach for addressing class imbalance, achieving better performance compared to alternative methods."

The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models: ARIMA effectively captures linear patterns and seasonality, while XGBoost models the complex nonlinear residuals, resulting in a highly accurate and adaptive prediction pipeline. To enhance performance, the system incorporates parallel processing and distributed computing strategies for data preprocessing, model training, and inference. These optimizations substantially reduce execution time on multi-core systems, making the framework well-suited for high-volume and time-sensitive forecasting tasks. Experimental evaluations highlight the performance gains of the HPC-enabled implementation over standard sequential processing, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The proposed solution addresses key computational bottlenecks in time series analysis and provides a robust foundation for applying hybrid forecasting models to complex, data-intensive environments."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for higher frequencies in 5G is driven by congestion at lower bands. Higher frequencies provide faster communication and greater bandwidth, which are essential for supporting the growing number of wireless devices. Efficient and compact beamforming networks are essential, and the Butler Matrix is particularly notable for its energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and strong interference suppression, making it an ideal choice for 5G. However, the conventional series-fed Butler Matrix results in a bulky design that’s difficult to scale for large 5G networks. Although some multi-layer designs achieve compactness by eliminating branch-line couplers, crossovers, or phase shifters, these often suffer from transmission inconsistencies and phase errors. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel design that utilizes via-holes to compensate for the absence of crossovers and phase shifters and incorporates a back-to-back folding technique to maintain signal integrity while significantly reducing size. To ensure a fair and consistent performance comparison, both the proposed and conventional structures are fabricated on an NPC-F220A substrate with a thickness of 0.254 mm, a dielectric constant of 2.2, and a loss tangent of 0.007."

    "abstract": "Due to their critical role in energy supply and economic development, electrical distribution networks continuously need infrastructure upgrades and modernization. Replacing aging copper conductors with aerial bundled cable (ABC) has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing energy losses, enhancing reliability, and preventing conductor theft. This article examines the challenges associated with copper networks, such as equipment degradation, high theft rates, and maintenance costs. It introduces a numerical metric called the \"Replacement Index (RI),\" which facilitates the prioritization of low-voltage feeders based on technical and economic criteria. This index considers factors such as network lifespan, voltage profile, theft statistics, revenue from copper recycling, and the costs of installing ABCs. Initially, technical and economic analyses for each feeder are performed based on GIS information and actual operator data, and feeders in need of replacement are ranked according to the computed index. To assess the validity of the proposed method, one feeder from the Khodajou city distribution network was modeled using DIgSILENT Power Factory software. The results demonstrate that replacing the copper network with ABCs significantly reduces power losses, improves voltage profile, and enhances reliability."

To address this issue, the utilization of virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) has been proposed. VSGs provide inertial and damping responses by emulating the operation of conventional synchronous generators, thus earning their name. This paper presents an updated structure of the virtual synchronous generator that replicates the behavior of a conventional synchronous generator equipped with automatic voltage regulator (AVR) and power system stabilizer (PSS) control loops. Furthermore, an optimal high-pass filter for improved transient damping is integrated into the control methodology to enhance the dynamic performance of the microgrid. This approach is employed to improve microgrid dynamic stability and performance against transient disturbances. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparative simulations are conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the obtained results demonstrate an enhanced damping response through the proposed communication-less control strategy."

Accurate and timely rain rate forecasting is therefore critical for mitigating link degradation, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring network reliability. This study presents a comparative evaluation of four artificial intelligence (AI) models; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Transformer, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for forecasting hourly rain rates. A 14-year dataset (2009-2022) obtained from NOAA's Hydro-Estimator was processed using MATLAB and Python, with model training performed via sliding window sequences and hyperparameters optimized using the Optuna framework. Model performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), cross-correlation analysis, and rainrate exceedance probability curves. While LSTM demonstrated strong short-term alignment, the GRU and Transformer models achieved better performance across a wider range of rainrate intensities, especially in representing moderate to heavy rainfall. XGBoost performed reasonably well for light to moderate rain but overestimated extremes. These findings highlight the potential of sequence-based deep learning models, particularly GRU and Transformer, for improving weather-aware communication network planning in tropical climates."

The analysis focuses on four environmental indicators: Global Warming Potential, Damage to Human Health, Damage to Ecosystem, and Damage to Resources. The study found that the GIS substation has a slightly lower environmental impact than the AIS substation by 45% on Global Warming Potential and Human Health indicators due to electricity losses.

We introduce an iterative \"Hierarchical DBSCAN\" method to cluster a real-world Persian knowledge base, allowing for a focused, coarse-to-fine search pipeline. To robustly evaluate our system, we created a new multi-faceted dataset containing formal, informal, and challenging queries. Our experiments show that the proposed hybrid architecture, achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 79% and a Top-3 accuracy of 86% and also answering delay of only 0.115 seconds. This represents an improvement in both accuracy and speed compared to the optimal E5-Base model in the standard Direct Semantic Search baseline. Our work provides an efficient and validated blueprint for developing practical semantic QA systems for the Persian language."

The A2C agent achieves a substantially higher total reward (mean –4170.18 ± 210.18) compared to the heuristic and UCB strategies (approximately –5430.59 and –5396.43, respectively). This translates to a ~22–23% reduction in overall costs. Statistical significance tests (independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U) yield p-values of 0.0000 in all comparisons, indicating that the improvements are highly significant. These results underscore the effectiveness of the A2C-based approach in reducing inventory costs through intelligent and adaptive ordering decisions."

Eight samples were prepared by varying the volumes of 34 mM TSC (1.5 mL, 2.0 mL and 2.5 mL) and 0.3 mM PVP (1.5mL, 2.0 mL and 2.5 mL) to explore their roles as reducing and capping agents, respectively. The resulting AgNPs were characterized using Ultra-High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (UHRSEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), and UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS). UHRSEM analysis revealed that PVP significantly improved nanoparticle dispersion and uniformity, with the best morphology observed in samples synthesized with moderate amounts of both TSC and PVP. EDX results showed that optimal silver retention occurred when PVP volume was sufficiently high to stabilize the nanoparticles, while excessive TSC without adequate capping led to agglomeration and reduced surface silver content. UV-VIS spectroscopy further supported these findings, with distinct surface plasmon resonance peaks shifting in response to particle size and dispersion. The results emphasize the critical interplay between reducing and capping agents in controlling AgNPs growth, providing essential insights for the future fabrication of GQDs/AgNP-based sensors for heavy metal detection."

A 110 kV XLPE (crosslinking polyethylene) insulated cable with seven-year service was selected, the outer sheath was removed and the XLPE insulation layer was peeled. Firstly, they were thermally aged at 105° C as long as 180 days. Then, they were heat-treated at six discrete temperatures of 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, and 115° C for 24 hours, respectively: ranges from the standard operation temperature to the melting point of XLPE. The differential-scanning-calorimetry, gel content, and conduction current were done, to check the changes in thermal, molecular, and electrical performance. The results show that 60 and 120-day-aged samples present enhanced thermal and electrical performance with higher crystallinity and lower conductivity; but the 180-day-aged sample shows a slight degradation. After annealing, the melting point and crystallinity in all sheets increased following the increment of annealing temperature, and the conductivity gave the opposite changes. The optimum annealing point, which corresponds to the highest melting point and crystallinity, appears at 105, 105, 100, and 100 °C for the fresh, 60, 120, and 180-day-aged samples. At the same time, the damage in molecular structure results in the optimum point for conductivity appearing at a lower temperature of 105, 105,100, and 100° C, corresponding to the four periodical aged samples. Finally, we can get that the thermal-electrical performance for a seven-year serviced cable could be enhanced, if they were thermally annealed at proper temperatures above the limited temperature during the cable in long-term temperature, even if the XLPE insulation suffered a further thermal aging test."

Twelve distinct solutions were synthesized by systematically varying molar ratios (2.3, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0) and temperatures (90°C, 95°C, and 100°C). Polydispersity index (PDI) analysis revealed that molar ratio had a significant impact on size distribution, with a 45% variation across different ratios. MR 2.8 consistently yielded the narrowest size distributions across all temperatures. While temperature had minimal impact on PDI, with less than 5% variation for two molar ratios, a synergistic effect between molar ratio and temperature was observed at MR 2.8, where the most monodisperse particles were obtained at 95°C (PDI = 0.336). Zeta potential measurements showed good colloidal stability across all conditions, ranging from -33.4 to -38.8 mV, with lower citrate-to-gold ratios (particularly MR 2.3) demonstrating enhanced stability. The effect of molar ratio on zeta potential was minimal, with less than 11.1% variation, while temperature changes resulted in less than 11.4% variation in zeta potential for each molar ratio. Notably, the conditions yielding the most monodisperse particles did not coincide with those providing maximum colloidal stability, highlighting the need to balance these properties based on application requirements."

    "abstract": "SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSThis paper introduces a flow-based Bayesian updating framework for finite element (FE) models in digital twin (DT) applications, addressing the challenges of real-time parameter updating and uncertainty quantification. By integrating conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling, the proposed method eliminates the need for explicit likelihood derivation, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining robust Bayesian inference. A case study on a fork component demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, achieving mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) below 4% for density and elastic modulus predictions. Elastic modulus exhibited higher accuracy and more reliable posterior distributions due to its stronger influence on system responses.Key findings highlight the importance of parameter sensitivity and prior selection in prediction accuracy, with uniform priors showing reduced efficiency when true parameters deviate from the prior mean. The methodology provides an efficient and scalable solution for real-time FE model calibration, offering broad applicability in engineering domains requiring dynamic parameter updates. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle time-varying parameters and improving prior selection strategies to enhance robustness."

This study proposes an enhanced PCLA method using an improved Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to address these limitations. A four-element circular pulsed LiDAR array is designed to encode wind speed and direction into time-delay differences, enabling spatiotemporal parameter identification. A Peak Matching Likelihood (PML) method extracts Doppler frequency shifts (DFS) with high precision. The MUSIC algorithm is further improved via wavelet threshold denoising and covariance matrix reconstruction to suppress noise and improve spatial resolution. Experimental validation in wind tunnels simulating airport runway turbulence (5–25 m/s wind speeds, 0°–360° directions, -10–20 dB SNR) demonstrates superior performance: wind speed errors are stabilized below 0.2 m/s, DFS extraction mean error is 0.6 at 20 dB SNR (95.6% lower standard deviation than conventional methods), and direction errors are <1° for low-level winds and ≤2° for high-level winds in double-layer cross fields. These results validate the method’s high precision, low-SNR robustness, and adaptability to complex wind fields, meeting GB/T 31163-2014 meteorological standards."

However, the sparse-to-dense mapping is ambiguous, making it challenging for users to obtain segmentations at the desired granularity and causing them to engage in trial-and-error cycles. Although existing multi-granularity IS models (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, SAM) alleviate the ambiguity of single-granularity methods by predicting multiple masks simultaneously, this approach has limited scalability and produces redundant results. To address this issue, we introduce a creative granularity-controllable IS paradigm that resolves ambiguity by enabling users to precisely control the segmentation granularity. Specifically, we propose a Unified Granularity Controller (UniGraCo) that supports multi-type optional granularity control signals to pursue unified control over diverse segmentation requirements, effectively overcoming the limitation of single-type control in adapting to different needs, thus boosting the system efficiency and practicality. To mitigate the excessive cost of annotating the multi-granularity masks and the corresponding granularity control signals for training UniGraCo, we construct an automated data engine capable of generating high-quality and granularity-abundant mask-granularity data pairs at low cost. To enable UniGraCo to learn unified granularity controllability in an efficient and stable manner, we further design a granularity-controllable learning strategy. This strategy leverages the generated data pairs to incrementally equip the pre-trained IS model with granularity controllability while preserving its segmentation capability. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at both instance and part level demonstrate that our UniGraCo has significant advantages over previous methods, highlighting its potential as a practical interactive tool.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a consumer-centric decentralized federated reinforcement learning (DFRL)-based energy scheduling strategy for community integrated energy systems (CIES). In this strategy, each region assigns one agent that can independently manage the CIES by training its own local network. Different from both the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which relies on a shared experience pool, and the traditional federated learning reinforcement learning method, where a central server (CS) is required for parameter aggregation, our proposed DFRL algorithm allows the local agent only to share and update network parameters in a round-robin sequence without the need for a CS. This leads to simple algorithm design and easy implementation, and privacy is also preserved, as no agent has access to the local data of other agents, while still enabling cooperative optimization among the CIESs. In addition, as no CS is required, the single-point failure risk can be avoided. Experimental evaluations on a 4-region 5-equipment CIES show that RR-DFRL achieves a total operating cost of $201,250.39, which is within 8.46% of the Gurobi optimum ($185,556.65), and requires 0.636 s online computing time versus 6.37 s for Gurobi.

For cloud-free scenes, the surface pressure and surface albedo are fitted, the results are compared with ERA5 surface pressure and TROPOMI DLER datasets respectively. Several parameters in DISAMAR retrieval settings are tested, including the stray light settings, the fitting wavelength windows, the a-priori values of the fitting parameters, and the performance of oxygen cross-section datasets (JPL2008, HITRAN 2008/2012/2020). As expected, DISAMAR retrieves cloud mid-level pressure values closely matching FRESCO-S and ROCINN, especially when fitting the O₂-A band. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud top pressure show better correlation with VIIRS data when fitting the O₂-A band than O₂-B band. For thick clouds, fitting stray light is not advisable, and a specific a-priori value of COT is unnecessary. Using the HITRAN2020 dataset provides more accurate spectral simulations. Fitting the O₂-A band yields results closer to both FRESCO-S and VIIRS, while the O₂-B band yields results closer to ROCINN and serves as a useful supplement. Excluding high-residual wavelengths in the fitting window further improves retrievals."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel three-output-port bridge (TOPB) for multilevel inverters (MLIs), designed to optimize the interaction between input sources in both series and parallel configurations. Unlike conventional multilevel converters, which feature two output ports supporting only series interactions, the proposed TOPB includes three output ports, two of which interface with conventional MLIs or a power switch to enable parallel interactions alongside series connections. A four-output-port bridge (FOPB) serves as an intersection cell for two TOPBs, facilitating the extension to a higher number of voltage levels. A rigorous mathematical analysis compares the structural properties of the cascaded TOPB (CTOPB) and cascaded H-bridge (CHB) topologies. By modeling both configurations as graphs, we evaluate connectivity metrics, including adjacency matrices, Laplacian matrices, and algebraic connectivity. The results demonstrate that CTOPB-MLI exhibits superior connectivity, attributed to its three-output-port architecture. This freedom offers valuable insights for single-source, multisource multilevel converters, and store-and-forward energy MLI. Furthermore, a one-dimensional space vector modulation (OD-SVM) technique is introduced to efficiently control modular converters using predefined switching tables. This approach enhances performance and addresses challenges associated with conventional modulation techniques, particularly in managing noncomplementary switching signals. The CTOPB topology’s performance is validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental results."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming converters (GFMCs) have evolved into the enabler of modern power systems. When equipped with energy storage, they can act as either generators or loads. However, the modeling and control of paralleled GFMCs, including the GFMC operating as the generator and load, have not been fully explored. To fill in the research gap, this article proposes a dynamic phasor model of two paralleled GFMCs. The proposed GFMC model comprehensively encompasses crucial elements. In particular, transmission line dynamics are excluded from existing models yet proven to have a noticeable effect on system stability and hence should be modeled. Building on the proposed model, this article further performs stability analysis and derives stable boundaries, which verify that the proposed model achieves a 50% accuracy improvement as compared with the state-of-the-art model. Through analyses, it is revealed that a large line inductance or a low R/X ratio can translate into better stability in the low-frequency region, while an excessively low R/X ratio unavoidably amplifies the high-frequency oscillations caused by transmission line dynamics. Subsequently, such findings allow an optimal design of virtual impedance control. Experimental results validate the improved accuracy of the proposed dynamic phasor model and the effectiveness of virtual impedance control."

Here, we present a high-precision and wearable fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing system based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) for monitoring vital signs. The sensor head is a commercial FBG embedded within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, which can achieve an elastic modulus akin to human skin. In contrast to traditional demodulation methods that employ costly and bulky FBG demodulation equipment, we utilize OEO for demodulation, which has garnered adjustable sensitivity, rapid demodulation speed, and ultra-high instrument-limited resolution (approximately several orders of magnitude higher than optical-domain demodulation methods). By employing a mixer to down-convert the detection frequency to below 100 kHz, we achieve a sensitivity similar to high-frequency detection, thus significantly reducing the overall detection cost. Compared to intensity-based demodulation methods, our scheme, which employs frequency-based demodulation, offers greater resistance to interference. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the capability of the system for monitoring vital signs such as respiration rate, wrist pulse, limb movements, and facial muscle activity. This study establishes a new technical foundation for high-resolution and wearable vital signs monitoring technology, aiming to meet the future demands of remote disease diagnosis and health monitoring."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple approach to extracting the parameters of the single-dispersion Cole-Cole bioimpedance model. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that it is low-cost but accurate in identifying the bioimpedance models. The Cole-Cole model is simplified as a fractional low-pass filter (LPF) using a few electronic components. Based on a low-component count, the circuit can be realized using only a single operational amplifier (OPAMP), two resistors, and two potentiometers (POTs). The proposed technique can achieve a minimal error compared to the theory, ensuring accuracy. The Cole-Cole model parameter values can be extracted by measuring the filter magnitude and phase responses. The LPF topology inherently provides a low-noise output signal. Experimental results using different fruits are carried out to verify the method and compared with measurements from a commercial impedance analyzer to confirm the accuracy of the results, with the maximum errors of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sub>, α, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">α</sub> being 0.94%, 2.41%, 0.85%, and 1.52%, respectively.

However, current data-driven fault diagnosis techniques for bearings face three major challenges: difficulty in extracting fault features under variable-speed conditions, challenges in isolating compound fault characteristics, and insufficient data protection mechanisms. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Secure Federated Learning framework integrating a Dual-channel Convolutional Neural Network with a Transformer (SFLDFormer), which enables effective extraction of compound fault features under variable speeds and achieves accurate fault diagnosis. In terms of data protection, a noise-injection-based secure aggregation mechanism is introduced to effectively defend against data reconstruction attacks during the early stages of federated learning, ensuring the privacy and security of rotating component fault data throughout the distributed modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains high diagnostic accuracy for compound faults under both constant and variable speed conditions. This work paves a feasible path toward building a secure and trustworthy cross-enterprise collaborative diagnostic system."

To address this challenge, this study proposes an all-directional pedestrian tracking method using a rotary mmWave radar platform. The designed electro-mechanical system leverages Spatio-Temporal Multiplexing (STM) measurement scheme, enabling a single radar to function as multiple virtual radars to achieve all-directional continuous tracking measurement application. Furthermore, the Multiple Virtual Radars Tracking (MVRT) model is introduced to divide the generated virtual radar array form the elector-mechanical system into multiple independent all-directional tracking subsystems, thereby reducing detection error by fusing data from these subsystems. Additionally, the varying initial orientations of the subsystems create different relative angles for the pedestrian’s position, which introduces inter-subsystem heterogeneity. To address this, the Dynamic Weight Particle Filter (DWPF) is proposed, a specialized method that dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients for each tracking subsystem based on the pedestrian’s predicted position. Experimental results validate the method’s all-directional pedestrian tracking capability, achieving a mean position error of 0.10 m in U-shaped paths. The system demonstrates robust performance across various motion trajectories and numbers of pedestrians, even in challenging scenarios involving obstacles and multi-pedestrian intersections."

This study compares conventional ML and convolutional DL models for mapping Cymodocea nodosa meadows in El Río, Canary Islands, using WorldView-2 satellite imagery. An in-situ measurement campaign was conducted to generate an open dataset for segmentation. Evaluated models include Decision Trees, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Subspace KNN, Feedforward Neural Networks, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Pix2Pix models. Results show that DL models significantly outperform conventional ML models in detecting Cymodocea nodosa. The best model (U-net) achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 83% overall and 74% for Cymodocea nodosa, while the best ML model (FNN) only reached 62% and 23%, respectively. IoU was highlighted for its sensitivity to minor mapping changes. Additionally, a temporal analysis revealed a dramatic 96% reduction in Cymodocea nodosa coverage over 21 years, from 245.32 ha in 2001 to 9.31 ha in 2022.

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). The effectiveness of existing spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) heavily relies on the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of traffic data, which is frequently violated in practice because of distribution shifts owing to exogenous factors. While learning features that remain stable across all environments is promising for modeling robust frameworks, the fundamental challenge involves the decomposition of invariant features from the dynamic nature of spatiotemporal dependencies. In this article, we propose the disentangled spatiotemporal (DIST) graph neural networks, a novel framework for robust traffic forecasting considering distribution shifts. In DIST, latent invariant variables are explicitly decoupled from dynamically evolving spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling the learning of topology-agnostic representations resilient to distribution shifts. Specifically, we formulate a causality-driven learning objective that guides the separation of invariant variables from various exogenous factors. We then propose a spatiotemporal graph modeling module that can adaptively capture spatiotemporal dependencies in evolving traffic systems. Furthermore, we present a graph perturbation module to simulate topology variations during training, thereby encouraging the model to identify perturbation-sensitive dependencies and infer invariant and variant features for prediction and intervention tasks. The prediction risk and its variance on multiple interventional distributions are minimized in our learning strategy, allowing the model to identify invariant features, thus improving its robustness. The results of comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

This confers significant application potential for N-polar InGaN in red LEDs. In this work, we developed a novel metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth process for N-polar InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) and successfully fabricated N-polar red LEDs. We achieved a significant red shift in the emission wavelength of the N-polar QWs by increasing the growth pressure of the well layer and reducing the V/III ratio, as well as modulating the stress of GaN template layer. Compared to metal-polar QWs, N-polar QWs fabricated using the new growth process exhibited a wavelength red shift exceeding 100 nm at the same growth temperature. Utilizing the new growth process, the efficiency of N-polar green LEDs increases by 1.5 times compared to previous results. Further, we fabricated N-polar red LEDs with an emission wavelength of 615 nm. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of using N-polar InGaN for red LEDs fabrication, contributing to the advancement of nitride-based red LEDs."

    "abstract": "As data traffic and information services surge, 5G base stations (BSs) have become primary energy consumers in wireless networks, with cooling accounting for 40% of BS power use and driving high operational expenditure. This underscores the need for energy-efficient optimization of cooling control. However, existing model-based and AI-driven optimization methods face critical limitations in real-world deployments, including limited generalizability across heterogeneous BSs resulting from their high scenario dependence, the inherent tradeoff between control stability and dynamic adaptability under complex operating conditions, and high deployment costs due to computational demands. To address these challenges, this article develops a three-stage hybrid learning (TSHL) approach that integrates imitation learning, ensemble learning, and deep reinforcement learning into a three-stage offline-to-online architecture, enabling expert knowledge transfer from data-rich BSs to generate high-quality initial policies for data-scarce ones, while online learning ensures continuous adaptation to local dynamics. In addition, we propose a cost-efficient deployment mechanism that leverages only existing monitoring data without additional hardware costs, employs hybrid experience policy updates within a deep Dyna-Q-based architecture to enhance learning efficiency, and incorporates a safety-constrained exploration to enhance policy reliability. Extensive evaluations on both a simulation testbed and a real-world 5G BS demonstrate that TSHL achieves over 18.36% cooling energy savings and outperforms baseline methods in cold-start effectiveness, online adaptability, operational reliability, and overall cost-efficiency. These results highlight TSHL as a practical solution for sustainable 5G BS operations, especially for data-scarce BSs, such as retrofitted or newly established sites, offering a scalable pathway to network-wide energy savings."

    "abstract": "Although multi-view unsupervised feature selection is a promising technique for dimensionality reduction on unlabeled multi-view data, existing methods cannot directly address incomplete data, where certain samples are missing in specific views. These methods typically begin by imputing missing data using predetermined values, followed by performing feature selection on the completed dataset. However, the separation of imputation and feature selection processes fails to exploit their inherent synergy, as local structural information obtained from feature selection could guide the imputation process and, in turn, improve the overall effectiveness of feature selection. In addition, previous methods rely on similarity graphs based on Euclidean distance to preserve the local manifold structure but overlook the topological relationships within the data, thereby hindering accurate capture of intrinsic structures. In this paper, we propose an adaptive topological similarity learning for incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection method (ATSL-IMUFS) to address the aforementioned issues. ATSL-IMUFS first integrates multi-view feature selection and missing data imputation into a unified learning framework. Then, it adaptively learns similarity graphs for each view while simultaneously capturing the consensus topological relationship across views, effectively characterizing the local manifold structure. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ATSL-IMUFS compared to competing methods."

    "abstract": "Gecko-inspired adhesives have attracted considerable attention due to their unique combination of strong, yet reversible adhesion to diverse surfaces. However, their integration into robotic systems remains limited due to sensitivity to contact alignment, typically requiring near-perpendicular engagement. Yet, many robotic tasks involve varying approach and detachment angles, highlighting the need for adhesion that operates reliably across different orientations and loading conditions. This study addresses two key questions: Can the adhesion strength of gecko-inspired adhesives, integrated into robotic systems, be optimized using trajectory optimization? And is this optimization surface-dependent? A gecko-inspired adhesive was integrated on a robotic arm's end-effector, which attached to and detached from surfaces along various trajectories. The arm's energy expenditure for each attachment-detachment cycle, along with the corresponding adhesion strength, were measured. Online particle swarm optimization algorithm was applied to identify conditions that improve adhesion strength and facilitate detachment. Results show that trajectory optimization significantly improves both adhesion strength and detachment efficiency up to 17-fold, with surface-specific effectiveness. These findings underscore the importance of considering both the forces generated by gecko-inspired adhesives and the energy required by the robot to attach and detach from surfaces at various angles and positions. Using optimization, this study helps overcome current limitations in the use of gecko-inspired adhesives for robotic applications, including grippers and climbers."

    "abstract": "This paper jointly investigates privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning. In a decentralized network, honest-but-curious agents faithfully follow the prescribed algorithm, but expect to infer their neighbors' private data from messages received during the learning process, while dishonest-and-Byzantine agents disobey the prescribed algorithm, and deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors for the sake of biasing the learning process. For this novel setting, we investigate a generic privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning – the learning error caused by defending against Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve privacy. For a class of state-of-the-art robust aggregation rules, we give unified analysis of their “mixing abilities”. Building upon this analysis, we reveal how the “mixing abilities” affect the tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness. The theoretical results provide guidelines for achieving a favorable tradeoff with proper design of robust aggregation rules. Numerical experiments are conducted and corroborate our theoretical findings."

In the context of neurology and neurosurgery, such models facilitate the comprehension of brain structures and their morphological characteristics. However, commercially available models are typically derived from generic templates, resulting in limited anatomical accuracy.This work presents a computational pipeline for generating anatomically accurate 3D brain models from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, leveraging FastSurfer, a deep learning framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The segmentation process exemplifies the application of modern neural network architectures and machine learning techniques in the biomedical domain.

    "abstract": "The human hand is an extraordinary example of evolution, capable of performing a wide range of tasks from intricate manipulation tasks to powerful grasps. Replicating such versatility and dexterity in both robotic and prosthetic hands is a longstanding engineering challenge. Despite paramount efforts from academia and industry, robotic and prosthetic hands still fall behind their human counterparts in many aspects, including dexterity. Closing this gap is essential for robotic and prosthetic hand applications such as general humanoids, prostheses, service robotics, and human-robot interaction, in which the need for human-like capabilities is of high significance. This paper presents the design of a highly actuated, 24-DoF, tendon-driven anthropomorphic robotic hand testbed for dexterous manipulation tasks. The hand is designed to be lightweight, affordable, and accessible with readily available components. A series of experiments is conducted to evaluate the hand's design and performance. Results show that the hand possesses a comparable workspace to the Shadow Hand and high repeatability in finger movements, essential for accurate sim2real transfer."

Simultaneously, high-grade cold exergy released during liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification is largely wasted. To valorise both energy streams, this paper proposes a novel LAES-Brayton integration in which an intermediate closed Brayton cycle simultaneously harvests the excess heat from LAES discharge stage and the cryogenic exergy from LNG regasification. Thermodynamic modelling reveals that the integrated system attains an LNG cold energy utilization efficiency of 58.18 %, higher than the standalone LAES, and an exergy efficiency of 60.16%. These figures position the LAES-Brayton configuration among the most efficient large-scale storage options while offering additional operational flexibility for both the power grid and LNG terminals."

    "abstract": "Mangosteen is one of Thailand's most valuable tropical fruits, with ripeness levels significantly influencing its taste, texture, market value, and export quality. Conventional ripeness assessment relies on manual visual inspection, which is subjective and unsuitable for large-scale operations. To address this limitation, this study proposes an automated image-based ripeness classification system. A dataset of 2,478 mangosteen images, categorized into five ripeness stages and captured under varied natural conditions, was used for training and evaluation. The methodology begins with preprocessing steps, including color balance and Retinex, hueguided enhancement, and CLAHE combined with sharpening, to improve image quality and emphasize key ripeness features. Feature extraction is then performed using a CSPDarknet backbone, a PAN-FPN neck, and a decoupled detection head to capture both low- and high-level visual cues. The extracted features are subsequently evaluated with three models: YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientNetV2-B0. Experimental results show that YOLOv12 achieved the best performance with an average <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{mAP} {@} 0.5$</tex> of 74.0 %, surpassing Faster R-CNN (41.0 %) and EfficientNetV2-B0 (52.0%), confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system as a robust, non-invasive solution for smart agriculture and post-harvest quality control."

    "abstract": "This research investigates the classification performance of various modeling approaches, including single classifiers, ensemble techniques, and a novel hybrid framework that integrates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The proposed method, referred to as KNN(k)MLP Probability Aggregation (KMA), employs the KNN algorithm to identify the k nearest neighbors of a given instance. These neighbors are subsequently processed through a pre-trained MLP, which outputs class probabilities. The aggregated probabilities are then used to determine the final classification outcome. The evaluation was conducted using four benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Haberman, Heart, Sonar, and Pima. Experimental results indicate that the KMA model consistently outperforms conventional single classifiers and established ensemble methods in terms of both classification accuracy and Fl-score. The integration of KNN's spatial locality with MLP's pattern learning capability enables the hybrid model to effectively address the complexities inherent in real-world datasets. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid learning architectures to enhance classification performance across diverse application domains."

The material around the tumor consists of agar and water, whereas the tumor mimic includes water, agar, and silicon dioxide. This difference in the silicon dioxide content resulted in excellent contrast between the tumor and surrounding normal tissue in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Ultrasonic ablation was performed within the phantom using a single element transducer which is attached to an MRI compatible robotic system under Magnetic Resonance (MR) thermometry guidance in a 3 T MRI scanner. Based on MRI images it was possible to move the ultrasonic beam within the phantom very accurately. MR thermometry monitoring within the tumor revealed ablative temperatures as a result of sonications. Post-ablation MRI images acquired in a plane parallel to the beam revealed lesion deflection at the tumor boundaries. Overall, the developed tumor phantom model was proven a very reliable tool to assess ultrasonic protocols, and provides a high contrast tool for tumor identification."

    "abstract": "Due to its ability to generate high-quality 3D point cloud data, lidar sensors are widely used in many fields, especially in unmanned driving. However, in bad weather conditions, such as fog, snow, and so on, the sensor is easy to produce large noise, which affects the quality of 3D point cloud data. At present, there are statistical methods, such as SOR, and ROR, and methods based on deep learning, such as WeatherNet, which have more or less their defects. In this study, a 3D point cloud data snow removal technology based on Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) is proposed. Compared with ordinary deep learning, this study does feature extraction in the data preprocessing step. It introduces an attention mechanism into the GCN network for optimization, to remove noise points more effectively. We do a large number of experiments on the real WADS dataset to verify that our snow removal method significantly outperforms the baseline methods, which proves that our method achieves good results in point cloud denoising. The proposed method is designed with embedded and cyber-physical systems (CPS) in mind, offering the potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving platforms. By integrating multi-scale graph aggregation strategies with hardware-aware optimizations, the method establishes a new paradigm for resource-constrained cyber-physical systems."

    "abstract": "Limited radio transmission bandwidth seriously limits the ability to use wide-angle video in technology. This problem is caused by video compression techniques currently being substantially sub-optimal for large field-of-view, leading to video transmission not being fast enough. While modern video compression leverages spatial redundancy to minimise data from the visual periphery, it often neglects temporal redundancy. Our research focuses on wide-angle video processing, considering spatial-temporal human visual models, and demonstrates that incorporating temporal knowledge of human visual perception into video transmission could reduce up to 60 % of bitrate without loss in quality. To enable optimal video transmission, we developed a new method for processing spatio-temporal information. Its performance was validated through a human perceptual quality study that employed established 2D virtual reality datasets alongside a newly obtained dataset using our approach. We believe our research will open users ' eyes to see in real-time through VR headsets."

Multi-branch patch embedding enables attention-based feature weighting across modalities. Validation on 8,318 dermoscopic images covering seven lesion categories achieved 92.0 % accuracy and 89.5 % macro-F1.

    "abstract": "Food safety and security represents a worldwide essential problem which needs advanced monitoring systems and quality assessment methods. The research investigates multi-angle imaging for food observation through computer vision methods to enhance both detection accuracy and reliability. The traditional food inspection methods conduct assessments from a single perspective which fail to detect vital defects that become invisible during viewing angles. The method provides better food property understanding through multiple-angle photography which enables precise identification of spoilage and foreign objects and texture modifications. The multi-angle imaging approach improves visibility through reduced occlusions and better feature extraction and surface detail detection which single-angle observations would miss. The proposed system combines machine learning models with computer vision algorithms to analyze multi-angle images which enhances the robustness of food quality assessment. Experimental data shows that different viewing perspectives boost classification accuracy while decreasing detection errors and enhancing real-time monitoring reliability. The research demonstrates that multi-angle imaging creates an automated system which provides detailed food safety evaluations. The research employs AI technologies to support global food security initiatives while improving food quality management standards and protecting consumer safety."

Bridging digital and physical play requires accurate recognition of OTB positions. Prior research has explored modular pipelines for board localization, square occupancy, and piece classification, as well as single-stage detectors. While these approaches demonstrate strong accuracy in controlled conditions, they often accumulate errors across stages, face latency and robustness issues, and rarely support interactive play. Thus, in this work, we present Y-LIChess, a YOLO-based system for live, interactive OTB play with engines and online platforms.

The study highlights the challenges posed by the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the high peak demand of EIIMs, which strain grid frequency stability. By incorporating ESS, the research demonstrates significant financial gains and reduced grid stress through peak demand management and RES integration. The paper presents a comprehensive model of a Distributed Multi-Energy System (DMES) that includes photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbines (WT), and energy storage devices. The model optimizes the generation mix, considering conventional and renewable sources, and evaluates the economic and environmental impacts, including pollution costs. Simulation results show that integrating ESS with wind and solar power reduces generation oscillations and enhances reliability. The study also explores demand response (DR) programs to smooth load demand patterns during peak hours. The findings underscore the importance of co-optimizing economics and performance, providing a detailed analysis of generation types and the combined use of wind, solar, and storage to overcome the limitations of RES variability."

Variable fault currents due to different modes of operation and intrinsic intermittency in renewable energy sources impose several and numerous constraints on relay coordination and settings. These factors can change the power flow direction as well as the short circuit current level. Therefore, unique protection coordination schemes may either degrade the relay’s sensitivity in the form of delayed fault clearance or result in the lack of operation for some faults. This paper presents an optimal and reliable adaptive protection algorithm for Microgrids considering generation contingency and develops suitable protection settings for all operating modes with optimized sensitivity and selectivity. Power flow and short circuit studies are performed in DIgSILENT power factory software, followed by obtaining the optimal settings of directional overcurrent relays (DORs) using GAMS software. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 9-bus typical radial distribution system equipped with directly connected conventional synchronous generators (CSGs) and inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs)."

    "abstract": "In everyday life, it is crucial to protect our data and communication. The necessity for secure message communication is not a novel concept. It has existed for a long time. Data security relies heavily on encryption methods. The advancement of message encryption technology has accelerated due to the utilization of networks and the online world. Cryptographic methods are deemed essential in instances of data theft or hacking involving private and sensitive messages. For secret communication, ciphers can be transformed into graphs. Graph theory is essential to a number of disciplines. Graph theory, in particular, is extensively utilized for encryption purposes because of its numerous properties and the fact that it can be easily represented as a matrix in computer systems. This paper presents the use of a self-invertible key matrix along with an adjacency matrix from a cycle graph for encrypting and decrypting messages, thereby creating a complex cipher. It is possible to decode the cipher without calculating the inverse of the key matrix, as it is a self-invertible matrix. Python is also utilized to create a schematic representation of the code for the provided input message, as well as to encrypt and decrypt it."

However, accurate classification of tumour tissues in histopathological images including bone tumour poses significant challenges due to the subtle variations of the different classes. In this paper the impact of CNN architecture depth on the classification performance is evaluated. Additionally, the effectiveness of preprocessing techniques such as contrast enhancement and data augmentation is also studied. One of the key challenges faced in this study is the need to balance model complexity with computational efficiency while preventing overfitting on small and imbalanced datasets. The model was trained using a bone or osteosarcoma tumour dataset consists of 536 non-tumour tiles, 263 necrotic tumour tiles, and 345 viable tumour tiles. Our results demonstrate that custom-designed, lightweight CNN models can achieve competitive performance, with the best model achieving a validation accuracy of 87.44% and a validation loss of 0.3594, often outperforming deeper, pretrained architectures. This research contributes valuable insights into effective CNN architecture choices for histopathological analysis, specifically offering a pathway toward more efficient and accurate bone tumour classification systems."

This study discovered these characteristics and their influence on students' commitment to reading. A complete survey is done, concentrating on variables including text difficulty, accessibility problems, teacher encouragement, topic preferences, and study environment. To investigate the data, a multivariable linear regression model was applied to evaluate the connections between independent characteristics and student engagement. Preliminary studies have shown that the combination of these components has a significant impact on the participation decisions. Several advanced machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were deployed. The Random Forest and GBM models achieved 95% accuracy in predicting student engagement. Machine Learning models were employed to identify and predict the key cognitive, motivational, and accessibility-related factors. This study emphasized the importance of solving these challenges to improve research skills, improve access, and establish a solid relationship between students and academic resources. In short, we can say that the results give practical advice to educational institutions to design a more effective approach to increase student interaction with research publications."

Therefore, grid-forming wind turbine generators (GFM WTGs) with the reactive power coordination and voltage control capability can be introduced to optimize the capacity of the AC filter. This paper considers the allocation of the GFM WTGs, and analyzes the influence of the AC filter and GFM WTG capacity on system stability based on small-signal model. Finally, the design requirements for AC filter capacity under different GFM proportions are identified to guide cost-effective configurations that meet stability and efficiency targets."

The system's dynamic power flow is unpredictable, and fault current levels are low. These issues make protection design difficult. To address this, this paper utilizes differential equations constructed between the voltage and current at both ends of the line and line parameters during a single-phase ground fault on a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Pi$</tex>-type equivalent circuit. It employs the recursive least squares method for fault distance parameter identification, proposing an AC microgrid protection method based on fault distance identification. The sliding window variance is used as the evaluation criterion for identification completion, and the fault distance is compared with the set distance as the protection action criterion. Finally, based on the AC microgrid model in PSCAD/EMTDC, the effectiveness of the proposed protection method was thoroughly verified. Simulation results show that this protection scheme can effectively, accurately, and quickly locate faults, thereby enhancing the reliability of DC grid operations."

In this work two biomimetic flight controllers based on the avian species, Humming Bird and Owl, and Harpy Eagle controllers, are presented and compared with a conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Using the maneuverability of Hummingbirds and the robustness of Owls and Harpy Eagles, these controllers adapt the gain tuning to flight patterns inspired by biology to enhance UAV behavior. These simulations are performed on a smaller 12 states model of a point-mass UAV in MATLAB.Trajectory, orientation stability, and energy efficiency have been evaluated. Evaluation illustrates that the HarpyEagle controller provides the most appropriate combination of robustness and efficiency being substantially better than both the PID and HummingOwl controllers. This paper spotlights the prospect of biomimicry in the further development of UAV control methods, particularly those involving missions where versatility and robustness are important concerns."

However, the quality of these videos is often compromised by specular reflections, which obscure anatomical details. While traditional image processing methods struggle with the dynamic nature of these artifacts, deep learning approaches offer a promising solution. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three state-of-the-art deep learning models for endoscopic reflection inpainting: Endo-STTN, DiffuEraser, and ProPainter. We analyze the distinct methodologies of each model, from the temporal consistency of Endo-STTN to the detailed synthesis capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that while all models improve image usability to varying degrees, they also present challenges, such as the potential for over-generation of details in diffusion models. Furthermore, we investigate the practical impact of these inpainting techniques on downstream clinical tasks, including polyp detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. The results indicate that reflection inpainting can significantly enhance the performance of these automated tasks, highlighting its value in clinical workflows."

Subsequently, a fixed-point iteration method is employed to derive recursive Kalman-type equations, providing closed-form solutions for state and covariance updates. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Comprehensive simulation results conducted under different measurement noise scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior filtering accuracy and robustness in non-Gaussian environments compared to conventional filters developed within the IMM framework."

Although the Ascon algorithm is relatively recent, SCA attacks that breach its security have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a low entropy masking protection scheme in order to raise the AscON algorithm's security levels against SCA. To evaluate the proposed methodology, the Ascon's permutation has been implemented in an Artix-7 Xilinx FPGA. The implemented design area overhead is 5.45% with respect to the unprotected implementation. A complete Ascon algorithm has been manufactured in a 65 nm TSMC ASIC technology. To perform experimental SCA attacks on the ASCON ASIC, a PCB has been designed and manufactured to specifically perform power measurements on the ASIC core."

Timely and accurate localization of oscillation sources during SSO events is essential for preventing cascading failures in the grid. However, traditional transient energy flow-based localization techniques-typically relying on fast Fourier transform (FFT) for feature extraction and numerical differentiation-are inherently restricted to steady-state analysis and exhibit significant sensitivity to noise. This paper presents an enhanced real-time localization method incorporating multiple second-order generalized integrators (MSOGI) to filter out fundamental and harmonic components in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$x y$</tex>-coordinate system.

Furthermore, a SOGI-based differentiation approach is used to replace conventional numerical derivatives, thereby enhancing robustness against noise. Finally, a 3 kW-rated DFIG-based grid-connected experimental platform with series compensation capacitors was constructed in the laboratory, which confirms that the proposed method can accurately identify oscillation sources during the critical transient initiation phase, thereby meeting practical requirements for real-time SSO localization."

This decomposition naturally enables parallelism by assigning separate CPU threads to different subnetworks.Unlike traditional PINNs, our method avoids global network coupling and monolithic training, significantly improving scalability. We implement a shared-memory parallel training strategy in PyTorch using thread-level concurrency and show that TD-PINNs achieve up to 2.29× speed-up on multicore CPUs without sacrificing accuracy.Experiments on both linear (heat) and nonlinear (viscous Burgers) PDEs demonstrate stable convergence and improved runtime, especially in nonlinear regimes. Compared to spatial decomposition strategies like XPINNs, TD-PINNs offer simpler implementation, lower overhead, and better speed-up under shared-memory systems.Our results highlight TD-PINNs as a lightweight, parallel-ready alternative to standard PINNs, well-suited for CPU-based scientific computing with minimal architectural modifications."

    "abstract": "In developing countries, two-dimensional (2D) Xrays are widely used in radiology due to their cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and lower radiation exposure compared to three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) scans. Despite the challenges in interpreting 3D anatomy from 2D images, these methods remain crucial in resource-limited settings. To improve diagnostic capabilities, techniques have been developed to reconstruct 3D images from 2D X-rays, utilising data-efficient and explainable model-to-modality approaches. This study presents simulation of landmark-constrained model fitting steps for 3D reconstruction of complex anatomy using a multi-object statistical shape, pose, and intensity model (SSPIM) and bi-planar digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) forming the model-to-modality approach for clinical adoption. The resulting mean error from the 3D coordinate point reconstruction was 0.28 millimetres (mm) for calibration frame control points, 2.82 and 4.18 mm for the reconstruction of anatomical landmarks of the SSPIM sample and foot CT image, respectively. The average distances obtained from fitting the multi-object SSPIM to the SSPIM sample and the foot CT image anatomical landmarks were 0.32 and 1.94 mm, and 1.94 and 2.54 mm for the 12 ground-truth anatomical landmarks and the 12 reprojected landmarks, respectively. Although the results of this study indicate that there is still a need to improve the 3D-2D algorithm, it also confirms the capability and feasibility of reconstructing complex anatomy from X-rays using 2D landmarks and statistical models. The use of this pipeline potentially offers a cost-effective and clinically useful solution to improve diagnostic accuracy with available low-cost imaging, especially in underserved regions."

    "abstract": "The change in resistivity of the buffer layer in high-voltage cables has been recognized as a significant factor contributing to ablative discharge phenomena during cable operation. In this study, the effects of abrasion and liquid immersion on buffer layer materials have been investigated, with resistivity measurements and microscopic morphological analysis employed for evaluation. The results have demonstrated notable changes in buffer layer resistivity after immersion and subsequent drying, particularly when the specimens have been exposed to alkaline solutions. Specifically, after abrasion, a significant decrease in resistivity has been observed, which has been attributed to the shedding of carbon black and the breakage of fibers. Furthermore, when the specimens have been exposed to acidic or alkaline solutions, a pronounced decrease in resistivity has been observed under acidic conditions, whereas the resistivity has remained relatively stable in alkaline environments. Similarly, resistivity changes during multiple immersion cycles have followed the same trend. These findings have suggested that resistivity characteristics can serve as a potential indicator for assessing the combined effects of abrasion and water immersion under the complex operational conditions of a 110 kV power cable."

By collecting more than 320,000 business data records of 391 transformers and 817 GIS units from 2016 to 2023, the entropy weight method was adopted for cost correction and deviation standardization processing, and a supplier evaluation system was established. The research results show that considering the full life cycle cost expenditure of suppliers can more accurately evaluate the equipment quality of suppliers.

This review consolidates finite element analyses of the temporomandibular joint published in the last fifteen years. The content of over one hundred studies is organized into three topics: (a) Orthodontic treatment, which reshapes pressure and tension in the area; (b) craniofacial deformities—chiefly mandibular projection; and (c) joint dysfunctions, in which temporary or permanent disc displacement and disc perforation significantly redefine contact pressure. Together, these models clarify how mechanical responses differ with treatment, anatomy, and pathology. The study also reviews treatment approaches, including occlusal splints and prosthetic joint replacements, in the context of biomechanical insight provided by finite element (FE) analysis. Prompted by the frequent occurrence of TMJ-related injuries among cyclists and motorcyclists, this study presents a concise synthesis of epidemiology, injury mechanisms, and current human body modeling gaps. It contributes to the understanding of TMJ biomechanics and supports the design of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions."

It is based on optimal Singular Value Hard Thresholding (SVHT) but for signals that are periodic or quasi-periodic in nature. An optimal thresholding technique can provide similar results with much smaller trajectory matrices and thus significantly reduced computational burden. The resultant Singular Value Decomposition process is significantly faster and shows similar performance to kurtosis based sliding SSA with a reduction in computational complexity of the order of 12,500 times. This technique is well suited to real-time implementation for denoising biomedical signals on the fly."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily linked to memory loss and cognitive decline, although less common clinical manifestations are being more frequently identified. Disruptions in gene expression and regulation have been increasingly linked to neurodegeneration. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) are powerful methods for analyzing transcriptomic diversity at the level of individual cells. Herein, analysis of snRNA-seq data derived from the entorhinal cortex of post-mortem brain samples from individuals either diagnosed with AD (Braak stage II) or serving as healthy controls was executed trying to identify potent biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in which these genes are involved. Preprocessing, integration, clustering and cell type annotation were performed using indicator-based methods followed by differentially expression analysis and enrichment analysis. UMAP was used for data visualization as well as Local Inverse Simpson's Index to evaluate the effectiveness of data integration. Leiden clustering was performed on the integrated dataset while the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was utilized for differential expression analysis. Cell-cell junctions were detected as the most significantly enriched category showing significant contribution to the structural integrity and signaling across the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, important pathways such as the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Lglutamate transmembrane transport were detected emphasizing the role of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. This approach supports the implementation of snRNA-seq data analysis in complex disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, providing new challenges for identifying fundamental biological processes on a molecular perspective."

However, its decentralized nature exposes FL to Byzantine attacks (e.g., data/model poisoning) and non-IID data heterogeneity, which degrade model performance and compromise robustness. Existing defenses either incur prohibitive computational overhead or fail to adapt to dynamic adversarial strategies. To address these challenges, we propose LightFedSelect, a lightweight framework that enhances FL robustness through client selection and layered aggregation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST dataset demonstrate LightFedSelect’s superiority over recent works, achieving 90.52% accuracy under label-flipping, backdoor, and noise attacks. Our framework reduces computational overhead compared to client-validation schemes and maintains stability in non-IID settings. LightFedSelect bridges the gap between robustness, efficiency, and adaptability, offering a scalable solution for secure FL deployments."

Such battery charging systems typically require operation over wide input and output voltage ranges. To meet this wide voltage operation requirement, this paper proposes a single-stage AC-DC power factor correction (PFC) converter integrating hybrid SEPIC and Cuk converter cells. It achieves true bridgeless operation (without any input rectifier diodes) across a wide output voltage range. Compared with its buck-boost PFC converter counterpart, it features low reverse voltage across the MOSFETs, leading to lower switching losses. Additionally, the proposed converter can effectively regulate the output voltage while maintaining a high power factor (PF) through a simple voltage-loop control. The operating modes and low voltage stress characteristics are analyzed. Finally, simulations verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed circuit."

    "abstract": "Urban air quality monitoring has been of pivotal importance with its direct health impact on public welfare, especially in densely populated areas. Conventional sensing infrastructures, although accurate, are spatially coarse and have limited capacity to identify localized pollution episodes. The current paper introduces AIRSPAN-X, a new and interpretable framework that combines adaptive federated learning, SHAP-based explainability, and sequential anomaly detection to achieve accurate and privacy-preserving air quality prediction. The model leverages XGBoost under a federated learning framework to guarantee data privacy without compromising prediction precision over decentralized IoT sensor systems. A data-heterogeneous adaptive aggregation layer ensures robustness against data noise and non-IID distributions. The proposed framework utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a global and local explanation method, to assist stakeholders in interpreting pollutant contribution to the Air Quality Index (AQI). For identifying irregularities, PrefixSpan, a sequential pattern mining method, is used to discover temporal outliers in pollution patterns without labeled data. Experimental evaluations on real outdoor urban air quality data from 22 districts across Tehran confirm the efficacy of the framework in achieving 98.64% accuracy, with strong scalability and interpretability. The proposed strategy addresses capital challenges of privacy, transparency, and irregularity detection and presents a one-stop solution to environmental monitoring in intelligent cities."

    "abstract": "Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) integration platform is a leading candidate for photonics terahertz communication and sensing systems. The heterogeneous integration of indium phosphide (InP)-based active components with TFLN promises the realization of fully integrated terahertz transceivers on a single chip. Silicon-substrate TFLN is particularly attractive for this purpose due to its favorable thermal properties and heterogeneous integration compatibility. However, the development of high-speed modulators on this platform has been fundamentally impeded by the challenges of microwave-optical velocity mismatch and high radio-frequency (RF) loss. In this work, we overcome this limitation through the synergistic use of a slow-wave electrode design and selective silicon substrate etching. This approach collectively ensures low RF loss, excellent velocity matching, and full compatibility with heterogeneous integration processes. The demonstrated modulator achieves a half-wave voltage-length product of 2.2 V·cm and an electro-optic bandwidth exceeding 67 GHz, with an extrapolated 3-dB bandwidth beyond 122 GHz. This work establishes a foundational platform for the future development of heterogeneous integrated photonic terahertz transceiver chips."

    "abstract": "The Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) based on point features is easy to fail in texture environment. Combining line features can solve this problem well, but it will lead to error matching and real-time reduction due to repeated feature extraction. Therefore, this paper proposes a visual-inertial tightly coupled SLAM based on multi-scale adaptive threshold feature extraction. Firstly, we introduce the quadtree algorithm to homogenize the feature points and introduce the adaptive threshold to filter them. Then, the LK optical flow method is used to track and match the non-key frames without the need for descriptor calculation, thus improving the real-time performance of the system. At the same time, we use the grayscale processed image to construct the image pyramid, and eliminate the feature dense area based on the gradient density filtering mechanism to avoid redundant feature processing, which reduces the amount of calculation while reducing the mismatch. Finally, the line segments are double verified by the constructed double-layer rectangle, and the broken lines and short lines are merged from coarse to fine to further ensure the accuracy of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms VINS-FUSION, ORB-SLAM3, and PL-VINS. In real-world scenarios, the average absolute pose error (APE) of our method is only 2.285 m, which represents a reduction of 63.4%, 22.9%, and 34.6% compared to VINS-FUSION, ORB-SLAM3, and PL-VINS, respectively."

However, developing a robot e-skin that can cover the entire surface of a robot on a large scale still faces significant challenges in terms of flexibility, lightweight design, less-wires, and reduced computational complexity in signal processing to enhance robustness and biocompatibility. Inspired by the biological structure of the epidermis and dermis in human skin, this paper proposes a full-textile, less-wires, flexible robot e-skin suitable for large-area applications that can simultaneously and in real-time detect key tactile information such as touch position and force. The robot e-skin employs a cotton textile substrate integrated with a sensing layer of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and natural silk sericin, achieving lightweight and flexible mechanical properties. Integration with the CR5 collaborative robot demonstrates the tremendous potential of this electronic skin in enhancing human-machine interaction and safety collision avoidance."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel lag-aware dual-stream (LADS) framework and a carefully curated dual-view video dataset for automatic Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification through imitation tasks. In contrast to prior single-view approaches that overlook the interactive dynamics of imitation, our dataset is the first to capture synchronized experimenter-child interactions with rich pose and motion features. Building on this data, the LADS framework explicitly learns the temporal alignment between the experimenter’s demonstration and the child’s imitative response. A Lag-Aware Alignment module uses constrained cross-attention to compute an adaptive time warping and extract per-frame lag feature, revealing delays in the child’s imitation. Additionally, a lightweight diffusion-based regularizer enforces representation consistency by denoising perturbed child features conditioned on the experimenter’s motion, improving generalization. We then achieve the classification of ASD versus Typical Development (TD) behavior by integrating the aligned dual-stream features, imitation lag, and action discrepancy within an attention-pooling classifier. Experiments on our dual-view imitation dataset show that LADS significantly outperforms conventional single-stream models and a recent dyadic transformer baseline, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy. The results demonstrate the importance of modeling interpersonal timing in social behavior analysis. Our work provides a new, public dataset and a computational tool for interdisciplinary research, bridging computer vision and psychological studies of autism. Both dataset and code will be made publicly available."

By leveraging dedicated LSTM-based classifiers and feature extraction techniques such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), this approach automatically identifies specific error types, including phoneme substitutions, omissions, and vowel mispronunciations. In addition, a hierarchical deep learning framework employing attention mechanisms and dynamic time warping is applied to quantify motor planning deficits associated with childhood apraxia of speech, while a reinforcement learning agent adapts therapy prompts based on individual performance. Data were collected from eight children per disorder category along with a normative sample of twenty typically developing children, providing a basis for personalized intervention and progress monitoring. ArticuLearn is designed to complement traditional therapy methods by offering an accessible, scalable solution that supports remote intervention and enhances clinical decision-making. Pilot evaluations suggest that the system can facilitate targeted speech exercises, improve self-monitoring, and foster adaptive learning in young users.

This approach integrates governing differential equations with measurement data to impose physical constraints and guide the modeling of unknown system components, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness. It further introduces deep evidential regression and combines the uncertainty-aware loss function with physical constraints to enhance the model calibration capability and enable efficient quantification of prediction uncertainty. We further validate our proposed method on experimental datasets of nonlinear dynamic systems, and the results demonstrate that the method effectively models system dynamics and provides reliable uncertainty predictions, even in the presence of missing variables in the system equations. This approach makes a significant contribution to the use of deep learning for evaluating uncertainty in dynamic systems, which is crucial for enhancing the reliability of measurements."

    "abstract": "Accurate LiDAR-inertial SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging due to transient moving objects and long-horizon drift accumulation. Point-only formulations offer weak structural constraints, while post-hoc dynamic filtering cannot promptly inform the frontend pose estimation and data association. To address these issues, we present SPLIN, a structured plane-based LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that couples real-time dynamic suppression with uncertainty-consistent estimation. First, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Incremental Static-referenced Dynamic Object Removal</i> (ISDOR), a lightweight module that detects and suppresses moving objects upon their first appearance at the frame level. Second, we develop a real-time, tightly coupled <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Point-Plane LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</i> (PPLIO) based on an iterated Kalman filter. PPLIO integrates ISDOR, an efficient plane extraction module, and an adaptive downsampling strategy, enabling robust operation across scenes with widely varying scales and dynamics. To mitigate long-term odometric drift, we further employ uncertainty-aware factor-graph optimization in the backend, yielding a complete, accurate, and efficient LiDAR-inertial SLAM system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SPLIN: ISDOR yields, on average, a 13.47% F1 improvement (best F1 on 15/17 sequences), a 26.67% precision gain, and a 64.26% reduction in runtime over state-of-the-art baselines. Building on ISDOR, SPLIN achieves the lowest localization error on 28/34 sequences—including highly dynamic and low-feature environments—while maintaining real-time inference at 6.94-36 ms per frame. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of ISDOR and the loop closure strategy to the overall system accuracy."

By reparameterizing the diffusion process with an incorporated energy function, the framework explicitly estimates the unnormalized log-prior, while MH corrections refine the sampling trajectory, mitigate deviations, and enhance robustness, ultimately enabling accurate posterior sampling for high-fidelity channel estimation. Numerical results reveal that the proposed approach significantly improves estimation accuracy compared with conventional parameterized DMs and other baseline methods, particularly in cases with limited pilot overhead."

    "abstract": "Extreme hazard events such as wildfires and hurricanes increasingly threaten power systems, causing widespread outages and disrupting critical services. To mitigate these risks, grid operators must act proactively—pre-positioning crews and resources or scheduling hardening activities—guided by forecasts that directly support operational objectives. Traditionally, utilities and agencies have followed a predict-then-optimize paradigm: first generating impact forecasts, then using them to inform response planning. However, this two-step approach inherently separates forecasting from decision-making, overlooking how forecast errors propagate into downstream actions and often producing misaligned or suboptimal plans. We address this gap with predict-all-then-optimize-globally (PATOG), a framework that unifies outage prediction with globally optimized interventions. At its core, our global-decision-focused (GDF) Neural ODE model jointly captures outage dynamics and optimizes pre-event resilience strategies in a decision-aware manner. Unlike conventional methods, our approach ensures spatially and temporally coherent decisions, enhancing both predictive accuracy and operational efficiency. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world data show that GDF reduces decision regret by up to 75% compared to two-stage baselines, enabling more effective proactive planning."

Among candidate biomarkers, the fraction of plateau phase (FOPP) emerges as a robust indicator of glucose dynamics. Hence, the neural interface is optimized for low-power measurement of the electrical activity of the beta-cells with high accuracy in direct readout mode and long-term monitoring in FOPP mode. The experimental framework was established using a perfused pancreas model, first in mice and then optimized for rats, with glucose-dependent signals captured via a custom 16-channel neural interface. Results confirmed the feasibility of extracting FOPP in ex vivo settings, though signal complexity differed from isolated islets in vitro. Additionally, a fabricated 8-channel electrical stimulator with adjustable current levels and optimized charge balancing technique, demonstrated the capability to meet physiological requirements for beta-cell activation. While integration of AI-based classifiers for advanced FOPP–glucose correlation remains a future step, this study establishes the foundational experimental and technological evidence for a next-generation closed-loop neuromodulator."

The model fully considers the dynamic characteristics and complementarity of different resources, and achieves day-ahead economic optimization and intra-day frequency regulation performance enhancement through hierarchical rolling scheduling. To address the problems of traditional scheduling algorithms, such as being prone to local optima and difficulty in balancing economic efficiency and flexibility, this paper proposes an optimization approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of diverse distributed energy resources, combined with a surge in cross-node data exchanges, has considerably broadened the attack surface, rendering microgrid economic dispatch vulnerable to escalating cybersecurity threats such as data tampering and denial-of-service attacks. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure distributed economic dispatch strategy. An equal-incremental-cost model is first formulated for a portfolio comprising renewable generators, battery storage, flexible loads, and conventional units. The dispatch algorithm is then packaged as a smart contract and deployed on Hyperledger Fabric, whose decentralised, unalterable, and traceable features protect data integrity and resist attacks. Experiments show that the strategy achieves both economic optimality and enhanced system security, confirming its practicality for real-world microgrid operation."

In response to these issues, this study introduces an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (IAPSO) algorithm. This algorithm integrates a nonlinear dynamic inertia weight strategy, an elite chaotic search mechanism, and a constraint-handling technique to effectively address the problems of premature convergence and parameter sensitivity that are often associated with traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO). To assess the efficacy of the proposed approach, comparative experiments were conducted against standard PSO and genetic algorithms. The findings indicate that the improved algorithm significantly decreases the standard deviation of coating thickness, enhances paint utilization, and increases convergence speed."

    "abstract": "Path planning for autonomous mobile robots in complex ground environments remains challenging, as conventional metaheuristic algorithms struggle to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) excels in global search but tends to fall into local optima in dense obstacle scenarios, while the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) offers strong local refinement yet suffers from inefficient initial exploration in large-scale spaces, leading to suboptimal path length, poor smoothness, and increased collision risks. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid PSOWOA algorithm. It adopts a two-stage strategy: initially, PSO's global search is enhanced via dynamic inertial weights integrated with WOA's nonlinear shrink-wrapping mechanism (control parameter a(t) decreasing from 2 to 0), ensuring early extensive exploration and late local focus. Subsequent local optimization by WOA incorporates a spiral disturbance mechanism, with a subset of particles undergoing spiral updates around the global best solution to escape local optima and improve smoothness. Parallel computing accelerates fitness evaluation (considering length, obstacle avoidance, and smoothness) in large-scale spaces. Experimental results show the PSO-WOA outperforms standalone PSO and WOA in complex environments, generating shorter paths (average reduction over 12% across) with superior smoothness and reduced collision risks. It exhibits strong stability, with minimal path cost fluctuations across 50 runs, validating robust adaptability in diverse complex ground environments."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of insufficient dynamic compensation for installation matrix errors and poor adaptability in weight allocation during attitude fusion of multi-head star sensors, this paper proposes an adaptive weight attitude fusion method based on covariance matrices. Traditional star vectorlevel fusion methods, relying on empirical weight allocation strategies, struggle to suppress error propagation under extreme conditions such as vibrations and stray light. By constructing a geometric constraint-driven adaptive Kalman filter model, this paper establishes a coupling mechanism between filtering parameters and the installation matrix, enabling dynamic compensation of non-reference head Z-axis errors. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the $\\mathbf{Z}$-axis error of fused attitude by over 50% under both steady-state and stray light conditions. Meanwhile, a quaternion-level attitude fusion framework is innovatively designed, which adaptively allocates head fusion weights based on attitude covariance matrices. This approach breaks through the limitations of traditional empirical thresholds, achieving a 28% improvement in X/Y-axis fusion accuracy when single-head errors double, with computational efficiency significantly superior to star vector-level methods. Night sky tests verify that the proposed method ensures high precision while reducing computational complexity through adaptive installation matrix filtering and adaptive weight allocation, effectively enhancing the robustness of multi-head star sensors under extreme on-orbit conditions. This work provides a new technical solution for spacecraft attitude determination systems."

However, existing studies primarily focus on feature alignment and overall performance optimization, while neglecting the refinement at the image token level, which is crucial for enhancing model generalization. To address this, we propose a combination of the Key and Value Selection (KVS) algorithm and a stochastic training strategy, which together enhance token-level learning by selecting image tokens relevant to text features. Our approach achieves a balance in the prediction performance between seen and unseen categories with relatively low computational overhead. Experiments on the Pascal VOC and Pascal Context datasets validate the effectiveness of the KVS algorithm in achieving this balance."

Our architecture employs advanced generative modeling to reconstruct perceptually faithful high-resolution MRI while preserving anatomical fidelity. Segmentation labels are appropriately scaled through parallel processing, and a deep neural network with robust architectural backbone generates corresponding high-resolution segmentation maps. The framework coordinates both components through joint optimization, the super-resolution module prioritizes features critical for tissue boundary detection, while the segmentation network adapts to characteristics of synthetically enhanced images. The framework demonstrates particular efficacy for challenging anatomical regions typically obscured in low-resolution acquisitions. Our method enables quantitative analysis of rapid acquisition protocols previously considered inadequate for morphometric assessment, potentially expanding access to advanced neuroimaging capabilities across resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of compute-intensive applications has created a pressing need for computing architectures that effectively balance flexibility, efficiency, and performance. While Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a good level of flexibility, they suffer from high configuration overhead and energy consumption. Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) provide a more energy-efficient alternative with lower configuration costs. They can be customized for domainspecific applications by modifying their coarse-grained processing elements to execute particular sequences of operations. In fact, their domain-specific nature can be used to further improve their energy efficiency and reduce their area overhead by exploiting computing fabric specialization. This can be achieved by replacing homogeneous processing elements with a subset of heterogeneous, more optimized ones that are specifically suited to the target application domain. However, achieving an optimal CGRA configuration requires extensive design space exploration (DSE), which involves evaluating many architectural possibilities. Existing CGRA frameworks struggle with slow and inefficient exploration due to long runtimes and constrained customization options. These issues make it hard to find the best configurations rapidly. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents Genetic Algorithm-based CGRA Generator (GA-CG), a framework that enhances DSE in the CGRA design process. GA-CG uses a genetic algorithm to discover an efficient structural configuration, thereby improving resource utilization and reducing power consumption."

Sugarcane plants are vulnerable to various leaf diseases. Early leaf disease detection is crucial for agricultural productivity. Traditional machine learning often relies on handcrafted features, struggles with high-dimensional data, and has scalability issues. Deep learning models overcomes these problems, still there are some challenges, such as the overfitting issue, the need for a large dataset, and less adaptability to new classes. This research addresses the challenge of limited dataset availability of sugarcane leaf diseases by employing few shot learning (FSL) and episodic training. This research proposes a Prototypical Network (PN) based few-shot learning technique to classify sugarcane leaf diseases. The proposed technique uses pretrained deep learning models for feature extraction, such as MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, and PN based FSL to learn from fewer training examples. The experimental results show that the PN with a backbone of ResNet achieved the highest test accuracy of 87 %. The analysis of the experimental results indicates that PN based few shot learning with deep learning models as backbone outperforms standalone pre-trained deep learning models while using limited number of sugarcane images."

Initially, a one-to-one air combat simulation environment is established, incorporating a six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) UAV model, states and actions design, rewards design, and termination logic design. The hybrid framework involves two phases: first, GAIL is used to align the agent’s policy with expert demonstrations, leveraging an expert database for decision support; second, the policy network derived from GAIL is utilized as the initial policy for RL, specifically employing a self-play proximal policy optimization (SP-PPO) algorithm for further training. The training process combines imitation learning and RL methods to address the limitations of reward function design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach significantly enhances training efficiency and decision-making performance, outperforming traditional RL methods. The findings indicate that the integration of GAIL and RL provides an effective solution for autonomous maneuver decision-making in complex air combat scenarios."

This study explores a streamlined alternative by employing DEP as the sole detection mechanism. We demonstrate successful differentiation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using two DEP-based parameters: cross-over frequency and movement velocity. E. coli and S. aureus exhibited distinct cross-over frequencies at 500–600 kHz and 1.0–1.5 MHz, respectively. Additionally, at 10 kHz, their movement velocities were measured at 0.00031 m/s and 0.00015 m/s, with the velocity curves showing strong resemblance to Clauscius-Mossotti Factor (CMF) profiles predicted by MyDEP simulations. These results not only validate the use of velocity as a complementary detection metric but also highlight the potential for developing simpler, cost-effective DEP biosensors. Expanding this approach to additional bacterial species may facilitate the creation of a comprehensive DEP-based detection database, supporting future applications in water quality monitoring and public health diagnostics."

To address this, this paper proposes a calculation method for tie-line maximum transmission power incorporating renewable energy and HVDC systems based on the energy function method.

Biomarkers such as ER, PR, and HER2 are typically assessed because they help inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions. Predicting these characteristics from imaging can support earlier clinical intervention, reduce reliance on invasive procedures, and contribute to more personalized care. While radiomics and deep learning approaches have demonstrated potential, comprehensive comparisons across these methods are still limited. This study evaluated handcrafted features, deep features, and end-to-end deep learning models for predicting ER, PR, and HER2 status from DCE-MRI. Each feature type was first assessed individually and then combined using early and late fusion. Handcrafted and deep features were processed through a pipeline that included resampling, dimensionality reduction, and model selection, while end-to-end models were trained using different initialization strategies and loss functions. The best models achieved AUCs of 0.659 for ER, 0.679 for PR, and 0.686 for HER2. Although late fusion generally improved performance, bias toward the majority classes persisted. Overall, the results suggest that combining different modeling strategies may enhance robustness in breast cancer characterization."

    "abstract": "The Ultra High Voltage Direct Current (UHVDC) transmission projects are predominantly based on Line commutated converter at present. Under this technical route, commutation failure leads to transient power deficits, posing a significant risk to grid stability, particularly in regions with multi-infeed HVDC areas. To address this issue, a novel Controllable Line Commutated Converter (CLCC) has been proposed. This topology utilizes fully controllable devices to transfer current and achieve rapid inter-arm commutation by turning off the current through devices, thereby effectively mitigating commutation failure.This technology is scheduled for its first practical application in the Gezhouba-Nanqiao HVDC project. However, it has not yet been deployed in ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) systems. This study is based on the Xiangjiaba-Shanghai UHVDC project . It investigates the trial implementation and control strategies of controllable commutation technology in UHVDC systems. The transient, steady-state, and typical fault characteristics of the CLCC are analyzed.The CLCC technology is particularly well-suited for ultrahigh voltage direct current (UHVDC) projects, as it effectively addresses the issue of commutation failure, significantly enhancing grid security, operational stability, and the power hosting capability in multi-infeed DC areas. This study focuses on the engineering application of CLCC in UHVDC systems, proposes key parameter selection guidelines, and demonstrates its technical advantages."

    "abstract": "Entity resolution plays a significant role in enterprise systems where data integrity must be rigorously maintained. Traditional methods often struggle with handling noisy data or semantic understanding, while modern methods suffer from computational costs or the excessive need for parallel computation. In this study, we introduce a scalable hybrid framework, which is designed to address several important problems, including scalability, noise robustness, and reliable results. We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors. Subsequently, after retrieving a semantically relevant subset of candidates, we apply a syntactic verification stage using fuzzy string matching techniques to refine classification on the unlabeled data. This approach was applied to a real-world entity resolution task, which exposed a linkage between a central user management database and numerous shared hosting server records. Compared to other methods, this approach exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of both processing time and robustness, making that a reliable solution for a server-side product. Crucially, this efficiency does not compromise results, as the system maintains a high retrieval recall of approximately 0.97. The scalability of the ’Transformer-Gather, Fuzzy-Reconsider’ framework makes it deployable on standard CPU-based infrastructure, offering a practical and effective solution for enterprise-level data integrity auditing."

The results show that scheme III is the best: the pressure at the injection position is only 17.83 MPa, the pressure at velocity/pressure switching is 14.86 MPa, the clamping force is only 249.1 tons, and the volume expansion rate is only 3.277 %. The improvement effect of changing the number of gates shows obvious marginal diminishing phenomenon, considering the economy, the design of scheme II can also be considered."

The study also emphasizes the impact of different organic semiconductors on device performance. DNTT-based OFETs exhibited the highest charge carrier mobility, outperforming pentacene, P3HT, and polyimide. Furthermore, the effect of semiconductor layer thickness was analyzed by varying the pentacene layer from 20 nm to 60 nm in 10 nm increments. Although minor, these variations resulted in observable changes in the electrical characteristics, underscoring the importance of precise thickness control in OFET fabrication. Overall, the findings of this work highlight the critical role of material selection and structural optimization in the design of high-performance OFETs.

There is no doubt that defect identification is vital to software quality. The authors of this paper propose a hybrid intelligent model which incorporates feature selection processes with algorithms to increase accuracy in defect prediction. Using publicly accessible datasets from the PROMISE repository, including NASA's MDP datasets, the model attained a mean accuracy of 92.4%, an increase of 11.3% relative to traditional models. The accuracy increase of 14% alongside model complexity reduction of 25% from RFE and Mutual Information based feature selection methods demonstrate the robustness of these feature selection techniques. Additional tests done on the hybrid model of random forest and support vector machines confirmed the model’s reliability in addition to the successful generalizability tests. The claim that the model is adept at identifying accurate and precise measurements of fault-prone modules is validated by the experimental results, reinforcing the confidence in the model’s adaptability and robustness with regard to automation in processes of software quality engineering."

This allows the mesh generation method to possess both randomness and design controllability. Furthermore, simulations and sample tests of the random mesh structure within the radar band have confirmed that the generated aperture type random meshes exhibit excellent diffuse reflection characteristics. As this type of random mesh does not need to meet specific phase conditions and has less stringent requirements for lateral scale, it has potential applications in reducing the monostatic RCS."

Existing microgrid scheduling strategies have not fully considered the impact of component failures on scheduling. To address this issue, a multi-timescale scheduling method for microgrids considering component failures is proposed within a \"day-ahead to intraday to fault scenario\" scheduling framework. First, a day-ahead scheduling model is established based on day-ahead forecasts of generation and load. Then, using the grid power trading plan determined in the day-ahead stage and intraday forecasts, a rolling intraday optimization model is developed to mitigate the impact of wind power fluctuations on shorter timescales. Subsequently, an adaptive scheduling strategy under fault scenarios is formulated to dynamically adjust unit outputs, energy storage charging and discharging, and grid power transactions. Case study results show that the proposed multi-timescale scheduling method considering component failures can significantly reduce unplanned load shedding caused by faults and improve the economic efficiency and reliability of microgrid operations."

This change necessitates tackling complex operational and financial issues. Operators specifically need to handle the increased reliance on RES and the growing demand for EVs. The aim of this paper is to present an optimal planning methodology that uses the Lyrebird Optimisation Algorithm (LOA) to address issues related to the level of integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the strategic placement of EV charging stations. These difficulties include increased system costs, voltage fluctuations, thermal loading, and power loss. LOA is designed to be strategically placed in conjunction with the deployment of hybrid RES across several micro-grids, in order to accommodate EV charging stations with controllable charging capabilities. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, the simulation results are compared with various optimisation techniques. The results show that using LOA instead of other optimisation algorithms reduces voltage deviation by 66.45%, cumulative energy undelivered by 49.63%, and total cost by 32.90%. This planning methodology includes an innovative charging strategy that lowers overall system costs while improving power quality significantly."

    "abstract": "Zero-trust architecture is becoming very popular in IT security field these days. Many companies are now leaving traditional security methods and trying new approaches that focus more on risk assessment and sustainable frameworks. The main concept of zero-trust security is quite straightforward: you should not trust anything automatically, no matter if it is inside or outside of your network. This is a big change from old\" castle and moat\" thinking, where everything inside company firewall was considered as safe. But zero-trust is different-it treats every user, device, and application as potentially dangerous until they prove they are safe. This method works very good for today’s business environment where everything is distributed. Since employees are working from remote locations and companies are using cloud services heavily, the traditional network boundaries have basically vanished. Zero-trust architecture handles this situation by focusing on protecting individual resources instead of trying to secure one fixed network boundary. The framework makes security better by checking and authorizing access to company resources all the time. It works well across different parts of organization, giving same security policies whether someone is accessing systems from office, home, or any other place. What makes zero-trust really valuable is the way it spreads security intelligence through the whole technology platform. Every part-whether it is user, device, application, or data source-gets checked based on current risk levels and business situation. This creates many layers of protection that can adjust in real-time when conditions change. The system keeps detailed policies for different trust areas, making sure that access controls match how sensitive the protected resources are. These policies work through APIs and other connection points, so security decisions can be made fast and automatically. When organizations implement zero-trust architecture, they can get better security coverage for their entire technology system. It supports both centralized security management and local operational requirements, giving IT teams the flexibility they need while keeping strong security standards."

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Blended Control Latent Diffusion Model (BCLDM). BCLDM mainly consists of two parts: the forward process provides an efficient denoising foundation based on a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and the denoising process generates multi-scale control signals through a trainable control module to enhance spatial guidance, and combines a mask blending strategy to optimize restoration quality. Experiments on the MSCOCO-2017 dataset (5000 images) show that BCLDM performs excellently in text-guided inpainting."

    "abstract": "Shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators, known for their high force output despite being lightweight and compact, are increasingly attracting attention in fields such as robotics, medical devices, and wearable devices. Due to these advantages, many studies have been conducted on SMA actuators driven by Joule heating under static air conditions. However, ensuring precise and responsive control of these actuators in diverse and dynamic environmental conditions remains a significant challenge. In particular, the implementation of efficient cooling mechanisms—such as fan-based or liquid-based cooling—for rapid operation is critical for practical applications but still underexplored. Herein, we introduce a durable and adaptive SMA actuation system that operates under randomly generated current conditions. This system enables reliable prediction of SMA output force using machine learning models, even as environmental conditions change. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to predict the output force of SMA coils using time-series inputs of current, electrical resistance, and environmental temperature. This model is validated under both static air and flowing water conditions with varying temperatures and flow rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate a closed-loop feedback control strategy for the SMA actuator, highlighting its potential for precise and robust operation across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "Large and diverse image datasets have facilitated the recent advances in deep-learning-based computer vision applications. Whereas datasets with images depicting normal-weather scenes are plentiful, datasets with images depicting inclement weather conditions, such as haze, remain scarce due to collection difficulties. In response to this problem, we present a novel domain flow adaptation network (DFA-Net) that can control the haze density and facilitate the generation of realistic and diverse hazy images. DFA-Net employs a density variable to direct the network to learn and yield the desired images and is composed of four modules: a semantic extraction (SE) module, a haze extraction (HE) module, an image production (IP) module, and an image assessment (IS) module. The SE and HE modules are used to capture the semantic structure and style representation of clear and hazy images, respectively, and provide them to the IP module for refining the output images. The IP module is adopted to yield hazy images in a coarse-to-fine fashion, while the IS module is responsible for examining the realism of the synthesized results. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DFA-Net, which outperforms competing approaches by achieving improvements of up to 147% in quality, 237% in fidelity, and 354% in the diversity of generated images."

    "abstract": "In the field of optical sensing of characteristic defect gas in transformers, hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) gas cells suffer from high fabrication costs and complex manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, fabricating non-adiabatic tapered fiber gas cells requires precise control of geometric parameters, such as the length of the transition region and the waist diameter. Moreover, these structures inherently exhibit common-path interference, making them susceptible to environmental noise and limiting detection sensitivity. To address these issues, we proposed a low-cost and easily fabricated adiabatic tapered fiber gas cell, fabricated from standard single-mode fiber using a flame-brushing tapering technique. We fabricated the adiabatic tapered fibers with a waist diameter of 2.2 μm by optimizing the stretching speed and distance of the stepper motors, effectively avoiding the common-path interference caused by mode coupling in non-adiabatic tapered fibers. This process is simple and achieves a production cost that is only 1% of HC-PCF gas cells. Additionally, we developed a heterodyne Mach–Zehnder interferometric (MZI) sensing system for hydrocarbon detection. We moved the beat frequency carrier signal to 100 MHz by introducing an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) to shift the reference light frequency, significantly reducing low-frequency environmental noise disturbances on both the sensing and reference arms. Based on this system, we achieved a detection limit of 0.6 ppm for acetylene gas, with a linear correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.996 for the sensor response. This sensing approach provides a highly sensitive and low-cost technical solution for the real-time, online monitoring of acetylene gas in power transformers."

    "abstract": "Fluid antennas, including those based on liquid, mechanical, and pixel-based technologies, are poised to significantly enhance next-generation wireless systems by adaptively optimizing their radiation characteristics. Many theoretical analyses assumed near-instant reconfiguration, perfect channel knowledge, static or slowly varying propagation environments, and ideal material properties that rarely hold in practice. In this article, we dissect these common assumptions and contrast them with the realities of finite actuation time, limited and imperfect channel state information, rapidly changing fading conditions, electromagnetic coupling, and mechanical constraints. Through illustrative examples and simulations, we demonstrate how ignoring these factors can lead to overestimated gains in capacity, coverage, etc. We then propose modeling refinements, experimental validation methods, and emerging control algorithms that better account for real-world constraints. Our findings highlight that, while reconfigurable antennas remain highly promising for B5G/6G and Internet of things (IoT) applications, their full potential can only be realized by incorporating practical considerations into system design and performance evaluation."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Natural Things (IoNT) is the extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept to natural environments, with the ability to monitor the environment in real-time using integrated sensor networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and remote sensing. IoNT can offer solutions to the ecological crisis that is facing the world today, such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and depletion of resources. The survey addresses the technology behind the IoNT and its different applications in disaster management, forest conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and agriculture, among others. IoNT has been successfully applied to monitor the quality of water in remote river ecosystems and to irrigate precision agriculture. Furthermore, pilot projects have demonstrated that IoNT can be used to make decisions based on real-time data analytics so that it is possible to manage resources sustainably. The other aspect discussed in the survey is the consistency between the IoNT sensors and the commercial sensors, according to some case studies presented in the literature. In those works, it is also identified that the processes are experimental in sensor testing, data synchronization, and the functioning of standard metrics, which ensure the reliability and strength of IoNT sensor systems. Despite the fact that the IoNT has great strengths, it is still possible to encounter issues concerning data security, energy efficiency, and interoperability. The survey addresses these issues and identifies new trends, such as blockchain and autonomous systems, that can make IoNT applications more scalable and efficient to manage the sustainable ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. This work proposes an optical absorption-based model to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material and calculates the instantaneous optical absorption from the polarization current density associated with this dispersion model. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based approach in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The method is further validated against experimental results via simulations of a photoconductive device, where the Poynting vector-based approach results in divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong."

    "abstract": "Magnetically actuated soft continuum robots (MSCRs), which offer remote and wireless control via external magnetic fields along with high flexibility, have recently emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, the magnetic actuation forces of MSCRs are generally limited, resulting in inherent workspace constraints. To overcome these limitations, various design strategies have been explored, including the development of an asymmetric magnetized soft continuum robot (AMSCR). Although AMSCRs have demonstrated a significantly larger workspace than conventional MSCRs, a quantitative relationship between the magnetization patterns of embedded magnetic particles and the resulting workspace has not yet been fully clarified. In this study, an energy based kinematic analysis of AMSCR was conducted to address this issue. Specifically, the equilibrium posture of the AMSCR was determined by minimizing the total potential energy, considering different combinations of external magnetic field directions and internal magnetization patterns. Based on the resulting potential energy graph, the workspace of the AMSCR was quantitatively analyzed, and an optimal linear asymmetric magnetization pattern was identified. Furthermore, the proposed energy-based kinematic model was validated through finite element analysis (FEA) conducted using COMSOL Multi-physics, as well as through experiments performed on a fabricated AMSCR prototype. As a result, an optimal magnetization design method for linearly asymmetric AMSCRs was proposed and experimentally confirmed. The proposed approach is expected to be further applicable to the kinematic performance evaluation and design optimization of AMSCRs with various other magnetization patterns."

The system integrates real-time voice input, emotion recognition, and context-aware dialogue generation using GPT-3.5, followed by emotional text-to-speech synthesis via neural TTS. Lip-sync data is generated using phoneme alignment and rendered in sync with the avatar’s facial expressions and gestures. To enhance user trust and engagement, the avatar visually mirrors the emotional tone of the speech. A cultural adaptation layer is introduced to align voice output and speech style with Sri Lankan communication norms, including tone, pacing, and formality. Implemented using a Node.js backend and React + Three.js frontend, the system demonstrates strong potential for emotionally intelligent, culturally adaptive AI interactions. This work contributes a modular pipeline for building empathetic voice agents capable of enhancing realism and trust in human–AI communication."

In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts."

To address these challenges, we propose MCPNet, a 3D coronary artery segmentation network that combines Mamba and CNN. The encoder employs a Multi-Scale Gated Unit (MSGU) and a Mamba-CNN Parallel Fusion Module (MCPF) to build the backbone network. For complex coronary structures, the MSGU adaptively constructs multi-scale features to suppress noise interference and enhance the extraction of key anatomical features, while the MCPF module integrates long- range dependencies and local details. In the feature decoding process, we innovatively introduce the Convolutional Attention Feature Module (CATM) to achieve dual-feature fusion in both spatial and channel dimensions to optimize the decoder performance. Experimental results show that our model achieves accurate coronary segmentation, especially in challenging cases involving fine vascular structures, and provides competitive performance on large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageCAS)."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of three machine learning models in predicting type 2 diabetes, focusing on their accuracy, sensitivity, and generalization capacity. The methodological process was structured into three phases: data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation. The widely validated PIMA dataset was used, which includes relevant clinical variables such as body mass index, blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. During preprocessing, the SMOTE algorithm was applied to address class imbalance, significantly improving the detection of positive cases. Three predictive approaches were compared: Random Forest, XGBoost, and a hybrid model based on soft voting between both. The results showed that Random Forest achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 97.0%, followed by XGBoost with 96.4% accuracy. The hybrid model, while matching XGBoost in nearly all metrics, demonstrated greater stability and robustness in its results. These metrics included an accuracy of 96.4%, a recall of 98.0%, F1-score of 96.4%, and AUC-ROC of 99.3% for XGBoost and 99.7% for the hybrid model, while Random Forest reached an F1-score of 97.1% and AUC-ROC of 99.86%. These results surpass those reported in previous research, reinforcing the clinical utility of these algorithms for early diagnostic tasks. As part of the project, an interactive interface was developed for healthcare professionals, allowing the input of medical data and immediate predictions on diabetes risk. This tool, delivered as functional software to the Tuscapujio Hospital Center in Sacaba, Cochabamba, Bolivia, represents a practical and accessible solution to support clinical decision-making in real-world contexts. The study highlights the importance of rigorous preprocessing and proper handling of class imbalance to improve the performance of predictive models in medical applications."

However, these studies often fail to examine more than two attributes simultaneously or to explore finger dimensions jointly as predictors of stature. Furthermore, there is a lack of focus on this type of analysis within childhood populations. Therefore, this work aims to apply machine learning through the generation of association rules using the Apriori algorithm, with the goal of mapping these hand relationships and understanding how they behave in relation to stature. The study uses the Anthrokids database, which contains 3,900 entries and 16 attributes related to the hand, and was able to encounter a high-confidence relationship for the index finger length, thumb length and middle finger diameter individually as predictors of stature. When used together, they increase the predictive confidence, confirming that these two measurements are important when relating to stature."

In recent years, several datasets have emerged - mostly compiled through automated crawling of open platforms such as GitHub and GenMyModel. While these efforts have improved access to real-world modeling artifacts, the resulting collections often suffer from serious quality issues: they include syntactically invalid models, semantically incorrect structures, and placeholder or dummy content. Moreover, most models are not accompanied by textual domain descriptions, which are essential for understanding the intent behind the model and assessing its semantic soundness. Therefore these model datasets are far from ideal as a source for modeling exercises or empirical MDE research. This paper presents an initial step toward a community-curated golden dataset of UML models, designed to address these limitations. Our contribution includes i) a curated set of UML models, each paired with a natural language description of the modeled domain requirements, $i i)$ a publicly accessible web platform for exploring and querying the dataset, and $i i i)$ a structured process for community-based contribution and evaluation to support sustainable growth and quality assurance of the dataset. By fostering community involvement and providing high-quality, semantically grounded models, this work lays the foundation for a widely accepted benchmark dataset in UML-based research and education."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by diverse motor and non-motor symptoms, driven largely by dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. Traditional approaches to PD treatment have been impeded by the disease's clinical heterogeneity, highlighting the need for more specific subtyping methods. Recent advancements propose utilizing clinical and biological data to uncover biologically relevant PD subtypes, with neuroimaging being a suitable candidate given the disease's impact on the brain. Previous neuroimaging studies on PD subtyping have utilized small datasets and identified age-related subtypes of PD. We address these limitations by leveraging the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset and utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster neuroimaging data, while preserving clinical data solely for validation purposes. The analysis included 747 patients, each characterized by 12 brain volume features obtained through quality-controlled neuroimaging processing pipelines. GMM clustering revealed three distinct PD subtypes with varying severity of motor symptoms but similar non-motor symptoms and cognitive scores. The subtypes identified - mild, intermediate, and severe motor severity - demonstrated significant differences in motor symptom severity, mainly in terms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Our approach provides a stratification that could enhance targeted treatment strategies. Future research should investigate the integration of multimodal and longitudinal data to elucidate further the potential of neuroimaging-based subtyping in predicting disease progression and therapeutic outcomes."

This study aimed to employ Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to differentiate colorectal polyps as either benign (normal or hyperplastic) or malignant potential (adenoma or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA)), achieving a level of accuracy suitable for clinical colorectal cancer screening. OCT image volumes <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(1000 \\times 1000 \\times 1024$</tex> pixels) were acquired from polyps from 225 patients. En face and feature-enhanced en face images were created. The en face images were annotated by an expert histopathologist. The resulting datasets were used to train individual U-Net models to identify malignant potential. Following U-Net training, a two-stage fusion process was applied, aggregating the classification scores from multiple processed datasets and employing a range of traditional machine learning classifiers to achieve the final decision. The area under the curve (AUC) for the detection of malignant potential of all polyps was 0.90. In addition, the classification achieved an accuracy of 90.3%, sensitivity of 96.9%, and specificity of 81.5%. The results of this study confirm the potential of OCT imaging of colorectal polyps as a viable adjunct to colonoscopy that could enable leave-in-situ management strategies."

    "abstract": "Respiration Rate (RR) is an indicator of numerous conditions and its importance in condition evaluation and monitoring has been well established. This paper deals with RR estimation based on the photoplethysmogram (PPG), a signal that can be easily acquired by wearables and is already captured by pulse oximeters. PPG is modulated by respiration and thus statistical methods can be used to extract the respiratory information encoded in the signal. A critical preprocessing step of RR estimation is that of reliable PPG peak detection, which is a form of signal quality evaluation when incorporated in PPG beat segmentation. To demonstrate the importance of this step we compare three peak detection algorithms against three RR estimation methods and show that peak extraction based on beat morphological characteristics leads to better RR estimation. Furthermore, we propose a new PPG-based method fusion that leads to higher estimation accuracy. All methods are evaluated on CapnoBase, a benchmark database on respiration, the best method achieving a RMSE of 3.4 bpm for 60-second intervals."

A persistent challenge is functionally annotating these variants, particularly those in non-coding regions. Functional interpretation often remains limited to exonic variants, overlooking the regulatory potential of non-coding regions. To address this gap, we introduce VarOmeter, an integrative platform for automated functional annotation of genetic variants, with a strong emphasis on non-coding and intergenic regions. VarOmeter leverages a rich ensemble of genomic datasets and semantic biological context to prioritize causal genes and elucidate regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits. The platform supports advanced filtering strategies and offers an interactive reporting system to facilitate interpretation. By providing a systematic framework to evaluate non-coding variants, VarOmeter enhances our ability to decode the functional landscape of the genome in disease."

This paper explores how concepts already implemented in one domain can be transferred into the languages used in another domain to support the customization of domain-specific modeling languages. We propose a methodology for this domain-tuning of languages by identifying and leveraging overlapping concept needs between domains. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through the transfer of the concept of consistency from database management systems to model-driven engineering, mapping, e.g., the concepts of primary keys from databases to model element identity. Our proposed approach enables the fine-tuning of modeling languages to better align with the needs of specific application domains by re-using existing language concepts across the borders of domains. The result is an exploratory language engineering process that enhances the integration and expressiveness of modeling languages by crossing domain boundaries. We plan to apply our approach to other domains to gain further insights into its applicability."

    "abstract": "The diurnal distribution of aerosols exhibits significant asymmetry, and nighttime aerosol characteristic data are crucial for comprehensively and profoundly understanding the aerosol diurnal cycle and the impacts of aerosol–cloud interactions in polar regions. In this study, a universal nocturnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion algorithm is developed for lunar photometers using the ROLO (Robotic Lunar Observatory) Implementation for Moon photometry Observation (RIMO) lunar irradiance model. By combining observation data from the CE318-T sun–sky–lunar photometer at the Beijing-CAMS site, parameters such as the nocturnal AOD and Ångström exponent (AE) are inverted, and the inversion accuracy of the algorithm is assessed against nighttime aerosol products from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The piecewise normalization method of the RIMO model and the temperature correction module have been integrated into the algorithm to improve the accuracy of nocturnal AOD inversion. The AOD retrieved from all channels (440, 500, 675, 870, 1020, and 1640 nm) exhibits excellent agreement with the AERONET nocturnal AOD products, with correlation coefficients (Rs) exceeding 0.99 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) below 0.01. For these channels, more than 99% of AOD biases are within ±0.02, and biases in the 675 and 870 nm channels can dip to ~±0.01. Additionally, the comparative results of the AE indicate that the R and RMSE values are 0.981 and 0.071, respectively, with both metrics exhibiting agreeable accuracy. These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm, and high-precision nocturnal AOD products are expected to play a crucial role in regional environmental governance and global climate models."

Wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units, offer a non-invasive and cost-effective alternative for analyzing gait and detecting PD. Two neural network architectures were evaluated: a Long Short-Term Memory model, which achieved an average precision of 99.82%, recall of 99.80%, and F1-score of 99.81%; and a Transformer-based model, which outperformed the LSTM with an average precision of 99.90%, recall of 99.90%, and F1-score of 99.91%. The results highlight the potential of wearable sensor-based deep learning models for accurate, accessible, and noninvasive PD detection, facilitating early intervention even in remote or resource-limited areas. Also, the slightly superior performance of the Transformer model suggests its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal dependencies in gait patterns."

    "abstract": "The fluid antenna system (FAS) holds big promise in wireless communications due to the ability of reconfiguring the antenna position to enhance the spatial diversity. In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication scheme that exploits the FAS to combat a malicious jammer, which intentionally sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate receiver. In contrast to the conventional anti-jamming communication schemes that rely on antenna arrays to mitigate the unintentional signals, the proposed scheme uses the FAS at the receiver side which has multiple open ports sharing a single radio frequency chain. By rapidly switching the active port, the FAS receives multiple different faded signals which can be carefully combined to improve the desired signal strength and suppress the jamming signals. Considering the practical imperfections of the jamming channel, we formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem by jointly designing the transmit beamforming and the receive combining coefficients, subject to the general power constraints. We derive the semi-closed form solutions to the formulated non-convex problem, which remarkably reduces the computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed scheme is robust to channel imperfection, and the achievable rate outperforms that of the conventional fixed-position antenna schemes which have multiple antennas and multiple radio frequency chains."

The results show that the scheme can withstand multiple security attacks, such as impersonation, modification, man-in-the-middle, replay, and DoS attacks. At the same time, it can quickly cope with message loss while satisfying V2V efficiency. In addition, compared with other related V2V communication schemes, the scheme shows favorable results in terms of communication, storage, and energy consumption, which improves the security and performance during message propagation."

Through its user-friendly interface, Blynk enables remote access to security warnings and real-time monitoring, facilitating timely response. By providing automated, round-the-clock surveillance, the system lessens the need for ongoing manual monitoring and speeds up reaction times to possible threats. Smart-IDS helps protect network security by lowering threats, including DNS server assaults, router hijacking, and data breaches, and preventing unwanted physical entry. IoT technology integration guarantees real-time alarm delivery, allowing security staff to act quickly to safeguard critical medical infrastructure. This strategy improves healthcare cybersecurity by guaranteeing adherence to stringent data privacy laws and upholding an effective and economical security system.

Our proposed method demonstrates high prediction accuracy, achieving a mean plane angle error of 6.01 degrees and a mean translation error of 0.23 mm. This automated method promises to enhance clinical workflow efficiency and diagnostic precision."

The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$92.3 \\% \\pm 0.8 \\%$</tex> with a perframe inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub- 10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1 %), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide."

In this regard, a multi-agent multi-objective scheme is proposed to optimally operate the DN in the presence of DGs, DR and distribution network reconfiguration (DNR). The proposed objective functions ensure eco-technical viewpoints of both DISCO and private investors.

    "abstract": "Effective water resource management is essential for sustainability, requiring the integration of smart technologies to optimize efficiency and prevent water wastage. This study presents the design and implementation of a Smart Water Management System (SWMS) that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology and automated sensor-based control to address issues such as water overflow and dry-run conditions. The system employs ultrasonic sensors for real-time water level monitoring, an Arduino-based microcontroller for automated pump control, and an I2C LCD display for continuous status updates. Additionally, IoT functionality via the Blynk platform enables remote monitoring and system control, enhancing user accessibility and convenience. The methodology involved real-time water level acquisition through ultrasonic sensors, processed by the Arduino microcontroller, which dynamically regulates the water pump via a relay module. Abnormal conditions trigger an alert mechanism using an audio-visual buzzer system. Experimental validation demonstrated high accuracy in water level measurements with minimal error margins, ensuring precise threshold-based pump activation. The remote access capability provided by the Blynk app allowed seamless system control, enabling users to monitor and manage water usage from any location with internet connectivity. The SWMS successfully achieved its objectives, offering a robust, automated, and scalable solution for water conservation and efficient resource utilization. Future enhancements may include advanced sensor calibration n, AI-driven predictive analytics for optimized pump scheduling, extended connectivity features, and seamless integration with smart home automation systems. This research underscores the potential of IoT-enabled solutions in transforming water management practices, promoting sustainability, and contributing to the development of smart infrastructure. Experimental validation demonstrated high accuracy in water level measurements with minimal error margins, ensuring precise threshold-based pump activation. Quantitative results showed an average measurement error of only ±0.13 cm across five trials, with consistent pump response within the 10–13 cm threshold range. The remote access capability provided by the Blynk app allowed seamless system control, enabling users to monitor and manage water usage from any location with internet connectivity."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) are deployed with cells of different sizes and coverage areas in mobile networks to provide high capacity, data rate, and services to ground users, posing a challenge in establishing connectivity for remotely flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to differing mobility characterizations from ground users, the addition of UAV users connected to a HetNet adds mobility management (MM) challenges. These challenges maximize the number of handovers (HO) and degrade the performance of UAV users. This paper presents an intelligent Q-learning-based handover and mobility management (QHMM) approach that aims to resolve the challenges associated with MM and guarantee reliable and consistent communication for UAV users. Software-defined HetNet (SDHN) reduces the network complexity by separating the control plane. The proposed approach ensures enhanced connectivity and mobility support for UAV users by integrating Q learning and adjusting the antenna tilt (AT) angles of the Base station (BS) to select the optimal next cell for HO. The HO value is calculated based on multiple parameters, which include UAV direction, received signal strength (RSS), Communication distance, and dwell time. The results indicate that the proposed approach minimized the number of HO, outage probability, and maximized energy efficiency and user throughput compared to the state-of-the-art techniques."

This paper investigates joint optimization of cell association and power allocation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled low-altitude networks. We propose a novel dual-function framework where ground base stations simultaneously provide communication services to authorized UAVs and localize non-cooperative UAVs for collision avoidance. We establish a channel model capturing the relationship between communication rate and sensing accuracy, formulating an optimization problem that maximizes the weighted sum of system average sum rate and localization quality of service (QoS). The problem jointly optimizes cell association, communication power allocation, and sensing power allocation under UAV localization QoS and cooperative sum rate constraints. To solve the resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a joint optimization algorithm based on optimal transport theory (J2OT) that directly handles discrete variables without relaxation, avoiding accuracy losses of conventional approximation methods. J2OT decomposes the problem using optimal transport-based cell association optimization (OTC) and power allocation optimization (OTP). Simulation results demonstrate J2OT’s superiority, achieving 1.5 bits/s/Hz improvement in system objective and 7.5% reduction in localization Cramér-Rao bound compared to Weighted Voronoi and Iterative Water-filling baseline methods."

This study investigates state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging with structured clinical, demographic, laboratory, and biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed, comparing open-source LVLMs including general-purpose and medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that while most LVLMs accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy, all perform poorly in risk stratification. To address this, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), achieving substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. Integrating multimodal tabular data as text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive performance compared to prior CNN baselines. Our findings highlight both promise and limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, domain adaptation, and model calibration for clinical translation."

The aim of this work is to calculate the minimum number of drone stations required, as well as their locations, to connect a set of hospitals. To achieve this, we consider both the range of the drones and the operational range of the stations, which is defined by the distance over which a drone can be controlled. We initially identify and exclude hospitals that cannot be served because they are beyond the range of drones or stations. Then, we apply a heuristic algorithm to generate an initial set of potential locations for the stations. This solution is given as input to a metaheuristic algorithm that is an adaptation of the well-known Tabu search algorithm. This algorithm improves the initial solution through an iterative process. We evaluated our algorithm through both numerical experiments and a realistic case study, confirming its efficiency and applicability to the task at hand."

This paper proposes improvements to the Incremental Conductance (INC) method used in Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Traditional INC is susceptible to shading effects and exhibits slow response. To address these limitations, we integrate the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm with the INC method. First, the output characteristics of PV arrays are analyzed to establish an INC model. Second, GWO is incorporated into INC to enhance its global search capability and local optimization. Simulation models of PV systems are built in MATLAB/Simulink, comparing traditional INC, variable-step INC, and the proposed GWO-INC method. Results under varying irradiance conditions demonstrate that GWO-INC accelerates convergence to the Maximum Power Point (MPP), stabilizes output waveforms, and reduces response time compared to the other two methods."

In addition, there are problems such as poor precision of data analysis statistics and inability to mine and analyze useful information in large-scale data. Based on the Spring Boot architecture, an enterprise microgrid energy management and control platform based on artificial intelligence is proposed. The platform adopts a layered architecture to integrate data from different systems such as photovoltaics, energy storage, distribution networks, and charging piles into the enterprise microgrid management and control platform for analysis, thereby solving the problem of information islands caused by different system data types and transmission methods. Secondly, the virtual measurement points method uses logical operation rules instead of hardware equipment to calculate energy consumption such as electricity and water, so as to solve the problems of high energy consumption, high capital consumption, complex equipment distribution, and inability to directly measure the installed hardware equipment. On this basis, intelligent monitoring is carried out on key areas such as factories, production workshops, and distribution rooms to detect suspicious personnel and issue warnings in a timely manner. Finally, a carbon footprint analysis and calculation model is introduced into the energy management and control platform to monitor the main energy consumption in the park and analyze and calculate the carbon footprint. By comprehensively dispatching various energy sources such as photovoltaic, energy storage, wind power, etc. in the park, the park can generate electricity and use it for its own needs. The solution can effectively reduce carbon emissions, provide carbon reduction measures, optimize energy use strategies, and help companies achieve green transformation."

The framework follows a three-phase pipeline: feature-based pseudo-mask generation, binary classspecific segmentation, and iterative multiclass segmentation with pseudo-mask expansion and affinity-field regularization. Applied to six ecologically important sediment features, the approach progressively improves pseudo-label quality while reducing reliance on dense expert annotations, providing a scalable solution that can accelerate the annotation of seafloor sediment features.

In contrast with current communications networks, in which the transimission of the signals is carried out at the surface level, this will allow true global coverage including oceans and vast unpopulated areas. 3D global coverage has become a strategic goal and efforts are being put into its implementation with the current deployment of 5G networks and in satellite communications (SATCOM). This requires minimizing the energy losses experienced by electromagnetic waves in the GHz bands. To achieve this goal, the most promising solution is the use of active antenna arrays incorporating smart beamforming techniques to achieve directionality in signal transmission. This work presents the design and simulation of the transmitter path of an active antenna array operating within the European downlink frequency band for SATCOM on the move (SOTM) applications (17.7 to 21.2 GHz). It incorporates a compact phase shifter based on a vector-sum architecture and a power amplifier based on the concatenation of neutralized differential common-source pairs. The transmitter has been designed in a 65nm CMOS MM/RF process. It achieves a phase resolution of 11.25° over the 360° range, with a gain of approximately 22.5 dB using a 5-bit control word while consuming 30mW."

Finally, a preventive control optimization model is formulated with the objective of minimizing post-control active power losses while ensuring system security and stability constraints, generating online preventive control measures against wide-band oscillations. Simulation cases on a practical system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, providing technical support for enhancing renewable energy integration."

    "abstract": "In the field of intelligent embedded systems, the demand for multi-agent collaboration and personalized task processing without compromising user data is rapidly growing. To accommodate this need, we propose an Adaptive Federated Meta Reinforcement Learning method, named AFedMeta-RL, which combines the privacy protection of federated learning and the strong generalization ability of meta-learning. It can address the issue of insufficient adaptability of reinforcement learning in personalized tasks caused by differences in client environments while protecting privacy. The algorithm first implements a two-stage optimization strategy of meta-learning on the client side, fine-tuning the policy in the local environment to quickly adapt to specific tasks. It then further enhances the policy’s generalization ability through an adaptive validation phase. Meanwhile, AFedMeta-RL introduces a dynamic exploration rate mechanism that can adaptively adjust the balance between exploration and exploitation based on the agent’s learning progress and environmental feedback. On the server side, the algorithm employs a weighted aggregation protocol based on two metrics, training stability and task performance, to optimize the global model. Experimental results show that AFedMeta-RL achieves significantly higher average rewards than traditional methods and personalized federated reinforcement learning baselines in multiple test environments. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates a significant advantage in the cold start scenario of new clients, requiring only a few steps of training to quickly transfer the policy, thereby verifying its adaptability to new tasks."

This study utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNet-18 and LeNet, along with an Autoencoder for unsupervised feature extraction from unlabeled data. To enrich the dataset and improve model generalization, the L2 Penalty Regularization method is applied to generate synthetic data. The detection process consists of two stages: first, the Autoencoder processes unlabeled data, extracting latent features to improve accuracy in unstructured scenarios. In the second stage, these extracted features are fed into ResNet-18 and LeNet, which act as classifiers for effective cyber-attack detection. By combining pre-trained CNNs with deep transfer learning and Autoencoder-extracted features, the model achieves a 10% improvement in accuracy, primarily due to enhanced attack localization, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. The dataset, developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), consists of three subsets representing normal, disturbance, control, and cyberattack behaviors in the electric transmission system. The integration of Autoencoder-extracted features with CNN classifiers, along with the use of simplified CNN architectures, significantly enhances model generalization and accuracy across various attack scenarios."

We investigate whether embeddings from backbones like a generic ViT, DINOv2, and I-JEPA, combined with a simple clustering approach, are sufficient for identifying anomalies. Our methodology extracts both global (CLS token) and local (patch-level) embeddings, applies clustering (k-Means, HDBSCAN) to model the distribution of normal scenes, and uses a scalable vector database (ChromaDB) for efficient similarity search. The three backbones delivered comparable performance, with the generic ViT showing a small but consistent advantage in balanced accuracy. Although local embeddings provided a 3 % gain in balanced accuracy, their sequential processing time is considerably higher. This limitation could be mitigated through parallelization, potentially bringing their efficiency closer to that of global embeddings. In contrast, global embeddings deliver comparable performance while being approximately 256 times faster, enabling near real-time batch processing of 15 s video segments. The <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{k}$</tex>-Means clustering and the proposed retrieval strategy proved most effective, achieving a practical operational trade-off with a balanced accuracy of 82 %. These results suggest that ViT embeddings are effective for separating normal and anomalous patterns. Local embeddings appear to capture complementary and pertinent information, and we expect that with modest adjustments in the detection strategy, they could be further leveraged to improve anomaly detection performance."

    "abstract": "Recent research on motion generation and text-to motion synthesis focus on coarse-grained motion descriptions, neglecting fine-grained motion details and motion quality refinement. Additionally, current text-to-motion models, such as MotionGPT, lack multi-turn interaction capabilities, relying on single-turn and single-modality transformations, which limit their ability to integrate information from different modalities across interaction stages. These gaps leave critical questions, such as “Howwell is the motion performed” and “How can it be refined?” largely unaddressed. To address these issues, first, we introduce two fine-grained dance datasets—one focusing on jazz dance and the other on folk dance, which we have independently collected. Second, considering that dance motions are inherently complex and consist of long sequential actions, we introduce both global and local optimization during the motion encoding phase and employ Hidden Markov Model (HMM) temporal modeling to capture differential features between correct and incorrect movements, thereby optimizing the training process. Finally, we propose a multi-turn historical dialogue framework that enables three stages generation—motion assess, text instructions, and motion refinement—for input videos. This framework assists dance beginners by providing feedback on their movements, offering textual instructions, and delivering motion-based refinement. Experimental results on the jazz dance and folk dance datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative metrics, establishing a new benchmark for motion-text generation in the field of dance training."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of image acquisition technologies in broadcasting and multimedia services, together with advances in facial recognition, has raised serious privacy concerns. In live news or streaming interviews, audiences may legitimately view participants, yet automated systems can capture and recognize their identities without consent, creating significant legal and ethical risks. Face de-identification, which refers to the process of concealing or replacing personal identifiers, has therefore emerged as an effective means to protect the privacy of facial images. A significant number of methods for face de-identification have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art face de-identification methods, categorized into three levels: pixel-level, representation-level, and semantic-level techniques. We systematically evaluate these methods based on two key criteria, the effectiveness of privacy protection and preservation of image utility, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Our analysis includes qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the main algorithms, demonstrating that deep learning-based approaches, particularly those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, have achieved significant advancements in balancing privacy and utility. Experimental results reveal that while recent methods demonstrate strong privacy protection, trade-offs remain in visual fidelity and computational complexity. This survey not only summarizes the current landscape but also identifies key challenges and future research directions in face de-identification."

While demonstrating remarkable zero-shot ability, the LLMs still require fine-tuning on local datasets and substantial memory for deployment over the network edges. Traditional first-order fine-tuning techniques require significant GPU memory that exceeds the capacity of mainstream hardware. Besides, the LLMs have been expanded beyond text generation to create images, audio, video, and multi-modal content, necessitating careful investigation of efficient deployment strategies for large-scale foundation models. In response to these challenges, model fine-tuning and model-compression techniques have been developed to support the sustainable growth of LLMs by reducing both operational and capital expenditures. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods for deployment at the network edge. We also review state-of-the-art literature on model compression, offering insights into the deployment of LLMs at network edges."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image Clustering is a long-standing difficulty due to the huge spectral variability and significant nonlinearity. Deep subspace clustering (DSC) has presented incomparable advantages over traditional subspace clustering by learning robust features and nonlinear affinities. However, due to the neglection of hierarchical complementarity by solely using the deepest features and insufficient exploration of pixel relationships through single self-representation, the existing DSC methods suffered from degraded performance. To address these issues, this paper proposed an innovative clustering framework named dual self-representation based deep subspace clustering with multilevel joint regularizations (DDSC-MJR) for hyperspectral images. On the one hand, a dual self-representation module was developed to fully excavate the intrinsic affinities between pixels by consecutive self-expressions and affinity learning. On the other hand, both deep-seated and shallow features induced by a well-designed convolutional autoencoder were exploited in dual self-expressions, with multilevel joint regularizations utilized to promote their coefficient matrices to share a similar structural pattern. To fully leverage the advantages of multilevel self-expressions, a weighted residual fusion module was developed to adaptively fuse the learned coefficient matrices to create a more indicative and clustering-friendly adjacency matrix. Ultimately, a multifaceted joint loss involving data reconstruction, dual self-representations, multilevel joint regularizations, and graph regularization were put forward to simultaneously constrain each part of the network in the training process. The extensive experimental results on three public HSI datasets clearly demonstrate the large superiority of DDSC-MJR to the other state-of-the-art arts and indicate that it can be a promising tool for real applications."

To solve this problem, this paper presents an automated pest detection and monitoring system using a smart trap. The trap attracts major pests like yellow stem borer, leaf folder, and brown planthopper using a combination of UV light, pheromones, and insect wingbeat sounds. After catching the pests, images are captured and analyzed using the You Only Look Once-version 8 (YOLOv8) deep learning model. The system showed detection accuracy of 97.4%, precision of 96.8%, recall of 97.9%, F1-score of 97.3%, and mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 98.1%, showing strong and consistent performance. The average inference time is just 18.7 milliseconds per image, which is practical for real-time updates. The solar-powered system is simple to install, needs very little maintenance, and is therefore suitable for use in distant farmlands. Pest data is shared through a simple web interface, helping farmers take quick action and prevent excessive pesticide application. This solution supports cost-effective, ecofriendly, and smarter paddy farming by allowing early pest detection and better decision-making."

A major challenge lies in modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics under weak supervision, where precise frame-level sign boundaries are unavailable. While deep learning models have advanced CSLR performance, many rely on 2D CNNs that struggle to capture inter-frame motion, or require auxiliary modalities such as optical flow or pose estimation, thereby increasing complexity. To address these limitations, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Mixer (STMixer), a novel module that explicitly factorizes spatio-temporal learning into three sequential stages: temporal mixing, spatial mixing, and channel mixing. This disentangled design enables efficient and effective modeling of motion patterns and structural features directly from RGB video input. Integrated into a standard ResNet-based CSLR framework, STMixer enhances spatio-temporal reasoning without requiring additional modalities or complex preprocessing. We evaluate our method on the PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14-T benchmarks, achieving competitive performance with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 18.6 % and 19.0 % on the Test set, respectively. Notably, our model outperforms existing methods using similar backbones and matches the performance of more complex, multi-modal approaches, demonstrating that explicit spatio-temporal factorization offers a powerful and efficient paradigm for CSLR."

However, they often lack the huge amounts of data required to build efficient models. Multiple hospitals can contribute their data to create large data pools to train learning models. In the absence of trust and data privacy guarantees, hospitals may be reluctant to share sensitive data due to healthcare privacy protection guidelines, standards, and legal issues. Federated Learning (FL) enables multi-hospital collaboration to jointly build intelligent models without sharing sensitive data with each other. The participating hospitals often exhibit varying compute, storage, and dataset capabilities and tend to build customized models as per their requirements. Participants with different model architectures is one of the most pressing issues in FL environments. Classical FL aggregation algorithms do not support the co-existence of different model architectures in the system. To address this issue, we use a Knowledge Distillation (KD)-Based FL Algorithm (KDBFA) for efficiently detecting multiple diseases in Chest X-ray (CXR) images in heterogeneous setup. We perform an in-depth analysis of homogeneous against heterogeneous models in the FL setup with Densenet121, ResNet50, and EfficientNet models on the CheXpert Plus dataset. Our proposed algorithm achieves 86.04% accuracy in detecting multiple diseases using CXR images under heterogeneous model scenario. Performance of the proposed KDBFA is comparable to the homogeneous setup, with an accuracy of 85.91% with EfficientNet."

In the proposed system, each vote is signed using the voter’s private key and verified using the election authority’s public key, thereby ensuring authenticity, non-repudiation, and tamper resistance. To address performance concerns, the RSA-based signature verification process is parallelized using OpenMP, significantly reducing computational time compared to sequential implementations. Experimental results demonstrate notable speedup gains with increasing thread counts, though diminishing returns are observed at higher levels due to parallelization overhead. Despite this, the system maintains scalability and remains practical for large-scale elections. By combining robust cryptographic mechanisms with parallel computing, this framework offers a secure, efficient, and scalable e-voting solution well-suited for modern digital electoral environments."

The study reveals the voltage–power flow coupling mechanism and the interaction law of security limits. Conventional methods encounter challenges in characterizing the spatial distribution characteristics of voltage trajectories under practical operating conditions. This deficiency leads to an inadequate level of accuracy in evaluating the static stability limits of sections with nested causal relationships. The present study proposes a multi-temporal–spatial scale assessment framework for the analysis of the characteristics of voltage oscillatory instability under fault-free conditions. Firstly, the coupling influence of wind–solar resource fluctuations and the upper–lower section control on operating limits is quantified. Subsequently, a voltage trajectory prediction model that takes into account future power flow growth directions is established to analyze the dynamic correlation between spatial voltage distribution and power flow variation. It is evident that the interactive mechanism of static security limits for each section is clarified, provided that the constraint of voltage oscillations is considered. The results provide a foundation for the theoretical underpinnings of precise delineation of static voltage stability regions within high-penetration new energy power systems, with relevance to delivery scenarios characterized by intricate causal chains."

    "abstract": "Traditional pyrotechnic separation mechanisms for Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) suffer from high shock and non-reusability. This study presents a reusable, spring-actuated separation mechanism featuring integrated electro-thermo-mechanical design. A dynamics model incorporating both translation and rotation analyzed the impact of centroid offsets on separation velocity and collision risk. Simulations across eight offset scenarios and varying host masses confirmed the mechanism achieves the target $1 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ separation velocity even under a 20 mm X-axis offset, with no collision, and stability when the host exceeds 300 kg. Structurally, a dual-flange interface and differentiated materials (aluminum alloy, carbon-fiber composite) balance lightweight and strength. The electrical subsystem integrates sensing and actuation within a unified low-shock connector. Thermally, polyimide pads and MLI effectively suppress conductive/radiative coupling. The study establishes practical thresholds for centroid offsets and mass matching, providing key engineering guidelines for reusable ORU interfaces in modular spacecraft on-orbit servicing, reducing costs and extending mission life."

As a primary target of DSR, Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) present challenges for accurate modeling due to large variations in building structures, unknown physical parameters, and diverse operating conditions. This paper proposes a data-driven modeling approach based on Vector Fitting (VF). The method requires no prior physical parameters and relies solely on historical indoor temperature and TCL power data. Time-domain data are converted into frequency-domain responses using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the VF algorithm iteratively solves for the transfer function’s poles and residues to construct a compact linear time-invariant model. The method is validated using measured data from the NEST building complex in Switzerland from 2019 to 2022, with 10th- and 20th-order building models. The proposed approach achieves predictions that match the actual measurements perfectly."

Building upon this, a predefinedtime cooperative guidance law for the line-of-sight (LOS) direction is designed to ensure simultaneous target engagement by all missiles. For the terminal angle constraint problem, a terminal sliding mode surface designed by introducing a time-to-go term.

In this paper, a weakness identification method based on a volume scaling ratio factor is proposed, considering the uncertainty in load. A load interval model is constructed, and a new system load-shedding risk metric is introduced, along with its analytical expression, which reduces the computational burden. Additionally, a risk responsibility allocation criterion is established, enhancing the fairness and accuracy of weak link identification.

The objective is to improve information retrieval and support the preservation of cultural heritage. The research focuses on improving text preprocessing, embedding techniques, and clustering algorithms. The preprocessing pipeline includes word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, stopword removal, and noun extraction, with domain-specific dictionaries incorporated for improved accuracy. Various embedding methods, including FastText, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), WangchanBERTa, and BGE-M3, were evaluated. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), were employed to optimize clustering performance. Among the clustering methods tested—k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering, spectral clustering, and gaussian mixture models (GMM)—k-means with UMAP achieved the highest Silhouette score (0.7115), indicating well-defined clusters. Additional evaluation using Davies-bouldin index (0.3948) and Calinskiharabasz index (2297.5827) confirmed the effectiveness of this approach. The resulting clusters were semantically coherent and thematically distinguishable, comprising groups related to folk performance, rituals and cultural practices; identity, symbolism and social values; mythology, royal traditions and sacred narratives; and deities, warriors and legendary figures. Expert validation further ensured the semantic coherence of clustered terms. These findings contribute to the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) methodologies for Thai text and can be applied in AI-driven recommendation systems and digital cultural heritage preservation."

To address this, this paper proposes a discrete-time deadbeat model predictive current (DMPC) control strategy for PSFB converters. Based on a discrete-time output stage model, the DMPC strategy predicts inductor current at the next sampling instant and calculates the optimal phase-shift ratio online, achieving rapid current tracking. Validated via MATLAB/Simulink simulations, the DMPC controller demonstrates ultra-fast dynamic response with minimal overshoot under transients. Compared to conventional methods, it significantly enhances disturbance rejection and dynamic accuracy, proving its suitability for high-performance power systems."

Employing the nearest-neighbour tight-binding (NNTB) model and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, the results reveal that wider ribbons exhibit a linear increase in quantum conductance due to the proportional rise in the number of conduction channels. Metallic ribbons with larger widths support more conducting channels, enhancing their effectiveness for electronic applications. The transmission spectra demonstrate that broader ribbons feature denser and more prominent transmission peaks, indicative of additional subbands contributing to electronic transport. These findings underscore the critical role of width variations in modulating the electronic properties of AA-ABGNRs, providing a pathway for their optimization in advanced nanoelectronic devices such as transistors and energy-selective filtering systems. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum confinement effects and their influence on the tunability of electronic transport mechanisms in bilayer graphene nanoribbons."

    "abstract": "Ankle Osteoarthritis (AOA) is a form of joint degeneration that affects movement and overall quality of daily life, but it is more uncommon compared to knee or hip OA. Ankles joint is composed of three major bones: the tibia (shinbone), fibula (calf bone), and talus (ankle bone). As a result of the disorders' increasing cartilage deterioration, there is bone-on-bone friction and constriction of the joint space, which ultimately results in discomfort and decreased mobility. Prompt detection and classification of AOA using clinical imaging techniques, such as MRI and X-rays, is important for timely treatment and effective therapy. Precisely classifying the different grades of AOA is vital for timely identification and effective therapy selection. Traditional grading schemes depend on radiologists' subjective, inter-reader variability-prone subjective evaluation. The current research suggests a semi-automated method for assessing and rating AOA using MATLAB and Joint Space Width (JSW) assessment. Recognition of edges is used to emphasize bone edges after the raw X-ray picture has been preprocessed employing contrast enhancement and noise reduction procedures. The Euclidean distance within the talus, fibula, and tibia margins can subsequently be measured by individuals by choosing many pairs of points across the intersection region. These measurements are linked to predetermined OA severity classifications conforming to medical norms and normalized to millimeters applying an established metric. In addition, the method estimates the overall OA grade and calculates the average JSW. This method helps radiologists make increasingly precise and predictable findings while also increasing uniformity and lowering variability."

We propose a lightweight pipeline based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between frames sampled from videos and identify time points where the skinks are active in their habitats. We benchmark our pipeline against a deep learning approach based on the MegaDetector model, explore the influence of both the sampling rate and choice of difference metric on detection performance, and discuss the challenges of implementing our pipeline.

The insights drawn from the post-layout simulations confirm improved isolation, albeit at the cost of higher area consumption, lower output power handling, and higher insertion loss. The overall performance is evaluated using a figure of merit that combines these parameters, showing that the series-shunt configuration offers the best trade-off, while the analyzed approach may be advantageous in applications with area-constrained designs or very high isolation requirements."

    "abstract": "A Digital Twin (DT) is a set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of a natural, engineered, or system-of-systems. It is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin, possesses predictive capabilities and supports decision-making processes that garner value. Bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical systems is central to functionalizing a digital twin. Recently, Biomedical Digital Twins (BDTs) are poised to revolutionize biomedical innovation by enabling predictive, realtime modeling of complex biological and engineered systems. However, despite their potential, most BDTs fail to reach deployment due to a fundamental misalignment with clinical workflows, regulatory structures, usability requirements, and systems-level constraints. This paper introduces a new class of digital twins, termed Fit-for-Implementation Digital Twins (FiDTs), designed to address the translational gap through an engineering-informed, stakeholder-driven, and lifecycle-integrated strategy. The primary audience for this article includes biomedical digital twin innovators and clinical stakeholders (e.g. physicians, caregivers, and patient advocates). We present a novel translational framework that embeds three foundational constructs into the engineering of BDTs: Fit-for-Purpose for scientific and mechanobiological validation, Fit-for-Implementation for realworld deployment readiness, and Technology- and EngineeringReadiness for structured decision-making and maturity assessment across the Total Product Lifecycle. FiDTs evolve digital twins into dynamic, regulatory-aware, and context-sensitive ecosystems, capable of simulating system-to-system interactions, accelerating preclinical validation, informing adaptive trial design, and integrating with electronic health record infrastructure. To reliably maintain and sustain these biomedical DTs, we propose a Multi-Participatory Twin Engineering Model to anchor stakeholder co-development from ideation to implementation to ensure co-development with clinicians, regulators, payers, caregivers and patients from the outset. This paper outlines a scalable, modular approach that harmonizes simulation fidelity with deployment feasibility. It includes actionable tools for risk mitigation, accessibility modeling, and global context adaptability, enabling DT systems that are not only predictive, but also trusted, scalable, and ethically grounded. Furthermore, we present the application of the proposed framework for FiDTs to accelerate critical milestones in the end-to-end translation of next-generation dental restorative materials (e.g., composite resins, ceramics, smart materials, sealants) as a representative case study of BDTs in biomedical innovation. In advancing the FiDT concept for dental health, we offer a visionary yet pragmatic foundation for next-generation BDT engineering. This foundation supports translational science mandates, anticipates regulatory evaluation, and accelerates the delivery of accessible, sustainable innovations in oral health and beyond."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of systemic and ophthalmological diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and hypertension. While many existing approaches rely on grayscale or RGB image representations, this work explores the impact of color space transformations on segmentation performance using an optimized Attention U-Net architecture. The study evaluates 19 input variations: grayscale and individual channels from six color space models-RGB, YUV, HSV, HLS, CIELab, and YCrCb. All images were preprocessed using the CLAHE algorithm to enhance local contrast and suppress background noise, particularly beneficial for medical images with low illumination and poor vessel visibility. A key innovation lies in identifying the most informative channel from each color space and comparing segmentation outcomes across them. The Attention U-Net was trained on <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 5 6} \\boldsymbol{\\times} \\mathbf{2 5 6}$</tex> retinal image patches derived from the DRIVE dataset, using a composite loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice loss (weighted 0.2 and 0.8 respectively). Among all tested channels, the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Y$</tex> component from the YUV color space achieved the best performance, with a mean DICE coefficient of 0.879 on test patches and a maximum of 0.922. Full-resolution image evaluations further validated these results, reaching DICE scores up to 0.912 and pixel-level accuracy above 0.979. Statistical significance was rigorously assessed. A paired ttest confirmed that CLAHE preprocessing significantly improved segmentation accuracy (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.0001$</tex>). Additionally, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that models trained with the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{Y}$</tex> channel from YUV significantly outperformed grayscale-based models (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.0001$</tex>), with consistent improvement across all samples. The <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{Y}$</tex> channel also exhibited the lowest variance among all tested channels, indicating strong robustness and generalization capability. This research underscores the importance of color channel selection in medical image segmentation and shows that combining optimized input representations with attention mechanisms and hybrid loss functions can yield clinically meaningful improvements. The findings provide a practical foundation for the development of more reliable, color-aware computer-aided diagnostic tools in ophthalmology and related fields."

    "abstract": "Specifying and monitoring temporal requirements in Digital Twin (DT) systems is challenging, as writing formal specifications in temporal logic is often complex and inaccessible to domain experts. This typically necessitates close collaboration with software engineers, introducing communication overhead and slowing development. We present DTChecker, a reusable selfcontained monitoring tool for DT systems built on RabbitMQbased architectures. The tool enables domain experts to write temporal specifications in a browser-based editor with language server support. These specifications are automatically translated into Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas and evaluated in real-time on data streams from sensors or services. Robustness scores are streamed to a front-end dashboard to visualize how well the system satisfies the specified requirements over time. This enables domain experts to write and verify temporal properties easily, thereby improving the real-time monitoring of the DT. We demonstrate the tool through integration with an open-source incubator DT case study. Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/elyhSOiGuc4?si=V2TTsXgRcYaAU2X"

    "abstract": "Model-driven optimization promises the availability of meta-heuristic approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, for optimization problems to domain experts, without requiring deeper knowledge of the underlying technologies. Models directly serve as the problem specification, while model transformations form the evolutionary operators for exploring the search space. Evolutionary algorithms, however, are usually designed to operate on low-level representations (or encodings) such as bit strings or vectors of integers or real numbers. As models generally consist of multiple high-level constructs and are much more complex than the usual low-level encodings, a performance penalty is to be expected when operating directly on such models. On the other hand, models provide additional domain knowledge and, as such, allow for the design of more sophisticated evolutionary operators. In this work we compare the performance of evolutionary algorithms operating on high- and low-level representations of solutions on two problems, the class responsibility assignment problem as well as the multi-objective knapsack problem. The results show a clear advantage of high-level model representations in terms of solution quality, producing higher-quality results for all evaluated instances, which generally come at the cost of a higher total duration. The extent of the differences and their reasons are found to greatly depend on the complexity of the model and its instances."

However, much of the implementa-tion-both backend logic and user interface still involves substantial manual effort. FeatureLanguage is a lightweight domainspecific language built on top of domain models and introduced to enable code generation from high-level feature specifications in such educational settings. In this work, we extend FeatureLanguage to also support User Interface (UI) generation. This extension enables automatic generation of frontend alongside backend components, all from a user-defined domain model, layout related constructs, and UI annotations, which are all expressed in an extended class diagram. The result is a more complete transformation pipeline that reduces the implementation burden on students and instructors. According to a comparison of the generated UI screens against the manually crafted UI implementation over four course projects, on average $83 \\%$ of required UI elements per screen are automatically generated."

    "abstract": "Agile system development emphasizes minimizing unfinished work by focusing on the most prioritized tasks. While this approach improves efficiency, it can also lead to challenges in coordinating efforts, often resulting in inconsistencies. These issues become even more pronounced in interdisciplinary projects, where conceptual misalignment between domains are common. To address this, a modeling shared development approach can help reduce inconsistencies and foster alignment across disciplines. However, the modeling approach must be flexible, as concepts may exist at different levels of granularity and dynamicity. Flexible Multi-Level Modeling (FMMLx) supports this need by enabling adaptable representations while also offering mechanisms to control and constrain flexibility. This research proposes a mapping between these adapting mechanisms and the corresponding challenges in agile development. The resulting models and controls can be used to support a shared understanding of agile practices and manage variability. This paper presents the strengths of FMMLx to model prescriptions for agile methodologies in comparison to the existing strict two-level models. The results demonstrate FMMLx’s flexibility and applicability in supporting agile practice modeling."

    "abstract": "This study presents insights from a participatory modeling initiative undertaken during the 2025 SustainFood Collaborative Learning School (CLS) in Oyo State, Nigeria. The initiative engaged early-career researchers, smallholder farmers, and policy actors to collaboratively address challenges within the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus. Using tools such as Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs), Political Economy Analysis (PEA), and actor-factor mapping, the team co-developed a model centered on Interest-Free Credit Cooperatives (IFCs) to enhance rural resilience. The participatory process empowered non-technical stakeholders to engage in systems thinking, visualize complex feedback loops, and design sustainable, community-driven interventions. The resulting model positioned IFCs not only as financial mechanisms but also as platforms for capacity building, climate adaptation, and collective resource management. Key preconditions for success included multilingual facilitation in English and Yoruba, cultural sensitivity, and institutional collaboration. Despite challenges such as limited systems-thinking exposure and time constraints, the approach fostered shared ownership and conceptual clarity. A WEF-IFC Toolkit was proposed to scale the intervention, supported by participatory Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) systems. The study contributes to the discourse on inclusive systems modeling and demonstrates how participatory approaches can localize sustainability solutions and inform bottom-up policy integration in resource-constrained contexts."

Addressing issues such as complex control and difficulties in self-starting of the system, a coordinated startup control strategy with black-start capability is proposed. Stable MVDC collection voltage is first established by the offshore DC wind turbines (ODCWTs). Subsequently, the centralized offshore substation completes the uncontrolled charging and active charging processes using this voltage. After startup completion, the system enters the power transmission stage. The machine-side converter (WTVSC) of the ODCWT adopts active power control. The grid-side converter (GSVSC) generates the AC voltage reference through low-voltage DC (LVDC) link voltage control and then performs voltage/frequency control. Meanwhile, the centralized offshore substation switches to MVDC collection voltage control to achieve stable system operation. Finally, a simulation model is established in PSCAD/EMTDC to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs), when integrated with physical systems and their virtual representations, can support real-time analysis, simulations, and decision-making. A major barrier to creating DTs is the effort required to put together the techniques and technologies developed by subject experts. The Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) is a DT platform that helps in DT development by creating collaborative environments in which users can develop, use, and share DTs. While experts can create and customize DTs to their needs, non-expert users benefit from automated solutions for on-demand deployment and execution of DTs. Modern software engineering practices such as Development and Operations (DevOps) have produced architectural solutions for a scalable deployment of software products. In this work, we present our contribution to the integration of DevOps workflows with the DTaaS platform. We develop a cardiac DT for ECGbased preventive diagnostics of the human heart. The same DT is used to demonstrate an implementation of DevOps workflows on the DTaaS platform. We find that our proposed solution is suitable for time-sensitive applications and flexible enough to be used with other DT platforms."

    "abstract": "Achieving accurate and reliable performance in bionic hands is crucial for implanted magnets, which are used for tracking the muscle movements of amputee patients. Increasing the number of magnets is the first trivial action. However, there are two main challenges: (I) implementing many magnetic sensors is hard in surgeries for both the amputee and the doctor, and (II) increasing the number of magnets increases their interference, resulting in reduced performance. To find fewer needed magnetic sensors, this study suggests using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) for feature selection. In particular, we propose an error margin added to the cost function, which acts as a hyperparameter to select the best sensors. Compared to using a total set of 16 sensors, using only 8 sensors achieves an accuracy of 96.98% in predicting three hand gestures—wrist, fist, and thumb—in the second day actual experiment. This accuracy can easily increase if the data is obtained only from the 8 sensors in the identified locations because of the elimination of interference from other sensors, which the current dataset includes. These findings validate the proposed sensor configuration’s robustness and effectiveness in accurately distinguishing between hand gestures. This result also holds the potential for future experiments, implanting only 8 sensors to remove the interference from 16 sensors."

In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha$</tex> values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis."

This article develops a delay–Doppler (DD) domain framework that jointly models and compensates these impairments. First, we introduce an adaptive hard-thresholding (AHT) estimator tailored for sparse DD spreading functions, combining curvature-aware step-size control with hard thresholding and least-squares debiasing to enhance support recovery and reduce bias. Second, building on this estimate, we design a 2-D decision–feedback equalizer (delay-Doppler-domain equalizer (DDE)–decision-feedback equalizer (DFE)) that incorporates a windowed minimum-mean-square error feedforward stage and a successive interference cancellation feedback stage, thereby mitigating both delay spread and multiple Doppler components. Numerical experiments on a quadrature phase-shift keying image-transmission task confirm that the proposed AHT–DDE–DFE achieves superior image quality, lower bit error rates, and tighter symbol constellations compared with conventional greedy and global baselines, while maintaining competitive computational cost. These results demonstrate that sparse DD modeling combined with DD-domain equalization provides an effective and practical solution for wide-Doppler UWA links."

    "abstract": "Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug and-play LoRA patch into Deepfake generators to bypass state of-the-art defenses. A learnable gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZOMIN28/LoRA-Patching"

Our approach leverages a modular segmentation-and-vectorization pipeline, enabling robust and accurate reconstruction of detailed 3D geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing techniques, effectively generalizing from residential to complex large-scale floorplans.

    "abstract": "In non-uniform magnetic field environments around three-core power cables, conventional magnetic field energy harvesters (MFEHs) typically suffer from low power density due to the mutual cancellation of three-phase magnetic fluxes. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an omega-shaped magnetic field energy harvester (OS-MFEH) based on the amplitude and phase characteristics of the surrounding magnetic flux density. The proposed structure enhances the induced voltage and mitigates output degradation caused by flux cancellation, while also reducing demagnetization effects. A mathematical model of the harvester's output power is developed, incorporating the influence of the magnetic field generated by the harvester coil. Guided by this model, the core dimensions and material properties are systematically optimized to achieve improved performance. The resulting design not only achieves improved power density but also prevents magnetic core saturation—an issue commonly overlooked when coil-induced magnetic fields are neglected.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a variable-mode bidirectional LLC resonant converter equipped with two resonant branches, which enables wide-range output voltage regulation within a limited switching frequency range. By regulating the driving signals of the switches, the converter can switch between two operating modes during forward operation: dual half-bridge (DHB) mode and full-bridge plus half-bridge (FHB) mode. Correspondingly, during reverse operation, it operates in dual-path voltage-doubling (DV) mode and single-path voltage-doubling (SV) mode. Frequency modulation is adopted in all operating modes, and synchronous rectification technology is also integrated. Throughout all operational phases, zero voltage switching (ZVS) is implemented for every active switching device, effectively minimizing switching losses and optimizing the overall energy conversion efficiency of the system. A 2.5 kW experimental platform has been built: in forward operation, the DC bus voltage on the primary side is maintained at 400 V, while the battery voltage on the secondary side can be adjusted within the range of 250–450 V, thereby achieving wide output voltage regulation; in reverse operation, the battery terminal voltage ranges from 250 V to 450 V, enabling wide input voltage regulation."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a low-voltage-side parallel high voltage-side series isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter for single-cell battery energy storage systems (BESSs), addressing the critical challenges of high voltage gain requirements and low voltage/high-current operation. Two parallel staggered shunt boost units are used on the low-voltage side to reduce the current ripple and the current stress. The voltage gain is further increased by applying an isolation capacitor on the high-voltage side, which enables the converter to accomplish high-gain boosting without a high transformer turns ratio. Since switches with different performance are used in the two parallel branches to achieve cost efficiency, this paper further proposes a power active allocation strategy for the proposed converter. Despite the mixed use of switches with different conduction and switching characteristics, the proposed strategy dynamically optimizes the branch current allocation through duty cycle control while regulating the output voltage, thus improving the overall system efficiency, particularly enhancing efficiency under light-load conditions. Finally, a 250W prototype with 3.2V/48V is built to verify the working principle of the proposed converter, and the overall efficiency is improved by an average of 1.22% after adopting the power active allocation strategy."

    "abstract": "Markerless pose estimation is an accessible alternative to marker-based methods. Although Google MediaPipe Pose is a promising RGB-only solution, a comprehensive performance investigation of its 2D and 3D models for postural assessment is lacking. This study systematically evaluated the accuracy, reliability, and symmetry preservation of MediaPipe models at varying complexities, and compared them against a marker-based gold standard and a markerless RGB-D reference system based on Azure Kinect. Twenty-four healthy subjects performed static 40-second postural tasks, from which five categories of angular and linear measures were computed from frontal recordings to compare model’ behaviors. One of the primary findings was the counterintuitive degradation in 3D MediaPipe reconstruction performance with increasing model complexity. Indeed, the high-complexity model introduced severe distortions and asymmetries, which we demonstrated to originate from the 3D-uplifting process rather than robust 2D tracking. All 2D models showed excellent performance in frontal plane analysis, albeit with some limitations for specific angular measurements. This study revealed a clear trade-off between the precision of RGB-D systems and the accessibility of RGB-only models. In addition, the analysis provided detailed recommendations for selecting the most suitable model for specific applications of postural assessment. Overall, the findings suggest that current 3D MediaPipe Pose models should be used with caution for quantitative postural assessment, especially at higher complexities, whereas 2D models represent an effective and practical choice for many lightweight front-view applications."

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for respiratory diseases remains a significant challenge due to the complex multimodal nature of medical data. Existing systems often fall short by focusing on unimodal retrieval analysis or lack sophisticated retrieval strategies, which limit both diagnostic reliability and interpretability. To address this, we propose a novel end-to-end CAD framework that employs a large language model (LLM) with advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, leveraging multimodal retrieval and structured radiology report generation. The framework employs a dedicated vision encoder for binary identifying view types (frontal anterior-posterior (AP), Lateral View (LV)) and multi-label classification for 14 disease categories, with Grad-CAM providing visual interpretability. Concurrently, an advanced text encoder processes unstructured medical reports, enabling the generation of structured zero-shot reports. We propose three novel RAG approaches to enhance retrieval accuracy and reduce LLM hallucination by improving contextual alignment for medical report generation: (1) Caption-Augmented Fusion (CAF), (2) CLIP-Aligned Fusion (CLAF), and (3) Domain-Grounded Fusion (DGF). The performance of our radiology report generation (RRG) is rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive suite of lexical, semantic, and clinical metrics, including METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and CheXpert Labeler. The clinical relevance and diagnostic accuracy are further validated by a panel of expert radiologists, establishing a gold standard. Our proposed CAD system can accurately diagnose respiratory conditions and generate structured radiology reports within 21.39 seconds. This rapid and accurate system holds considerable promise for real-world clinical applications and is well-suited to meet the demands of modern medical practice."

    "abstract": "The Insulator is essential for high-voltage transmission systems, offering mechanical support and vital electrical insulation between energized conductors and grounded structures. In recent years, deep learning–based object detection has emerged as a promising approach for identifying defects in transmission line insulators. The performance of these methods largely depends on the availability of diverse, high-quality, and accurately annotated datasets. However, existing public datasets remain limited in scale and diversity, particularly in terms of defect morphology, which poses a significant obstacle to advancing intelligent transmission line insulator inspection technologies. In this study, we present the Transmission Line Insulation Defect (TLID) dataset, specifically designed to meet the requirements of practical insulator defect detection tasks. The TLID dataset comprises 712 raw images and 816 annotated bounding boxes, covering insulator defect samples across three material types (ceramic, composite, and glass), seven background scenarios (e.g., paddy fields, snowy landscapes, deserts), and two distinct viewpoints (close-range with large-scale features, and long-distance with small-scale features). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on the proposed public datasets and provide an in-depth analysis of the results. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in insulator defect detection for transmission lines and outline potential directions for future research."

    "abstract": "Reflection is a vital component of learning, yet it often faces the challenge of fragmentation, where individual learning experiences become disconnected, making it difficult for learners to see their relationships to past and future learning. This research seeks to deepen reflection qualitatively by allowing learners to structurally comprehend their own learning and connect it with new knowledge. Here, qualitative deepening of reflection refers to transforming descriptions from simple enumerations of learned content into more specific and exploratory accounts. To achieve this, we propose a system that leverages Generative AI to dynamically generate and visualize personalized “learning maps” from learners' reflective descriptions. This system serves as a scaffold for structuring (visualizing interplays between concepts) and contextualizing (positioning within related knowledge) the content of their descriptions. Findings from a demonstration experiment with first-year university students propose that employing these maps helps learners make their reflective descriptions more concrete and encourages exploratory activities that extend their interests toward more specialized concepts. While the preliminary study revealed technical and usability challenges that limited engagement for some participants, in this research, we present the architecture and effectiveness of the proposed system and argue that visualizing dynamic knowledge maps derived from learners' own descriptions is an effective approach to fostering the qualitative deepening of reflection."

Additionally, a web-based platform for bin management is developed. The experimental results indicate that the system is capable of accurately measuring waste levels within the bins and effectively supports long-distance data transmission.

This processing is the basis of many artificial vision algorithms required in the industry. Thanks to the RISC-V open instruction set and flexible architecture, it is feasible to explore different ways to accelerate heavy computations that nowadays impose relevant drawbacks to deploying some advanced vision processing on resourceconstrained semiconductor devices widely used in industrial applications. The CIP has been included in a custom SoC RISC-V-based prototype named SoC4cris, which is implemented on FPGA and 65 nm UDSM technologies. The CIP is connected to the CPU via the AXI4-Lite external bus interface in the SoC. It has been implemented using fully combinational logic to achieve the maximum computing power throughput. The CIP performance is compared to the CPU performance in terms of the number of clock cycles needed to fulfill a complete convolution layer computation task. The same test is executed with and without enabling specific RISC-V extensions for integer and floating point arithmetic to analyze the performance versus hardware resource trade-off. The results of our performance analysis demonstrate the exceptional efficiency of the CIP coprocessor. It significantly improves computation performance by a factor of six, all while introducing no considerable overhead in terms of hardware resources. This underscores the robustness and reliability of our design."

Time-domain Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and EEG spectral power (theta, alpha, beta bands) were extracted and analyzed per traffic segment. The results show significant and consistent physiological changes across traffic conditions. RMSSD and SDNN values decreased by 22.8% and 18.4%, respectively, under high traffic load, indicating increased sympathetic activation. Simultaneously, frontal theta power increased by 31.6%, suggesting elevated cognitive demand. These effects were observed in 4 out of 8 participants and exhibited region-specific patterns, particularly in frontal and temporal lobes. From a computational intelligence perspective, this work contributes (i) a well-structured, manually labeled dataset combining EEG and ECG in real traffic, (ii) evidence of feature separability across traffic conditions, and (iii) a methodological basis for developing data-driven models for stress and workload detection. The extracted features and synchronized multimodal structure are suitable for training classification models, enabling future implementation of personalized and context-aware cognitive state monitoring in intelligent transportation systems."

A genetic algorithm evolves orthonormal projection matrices that maximize the silhouette index, promoting class separability in reduced spaces. The method is evaluated across several benchmark datasets and compared against PCA+LDA and Genetic LDA (GLDA). Results demonstrate that GPDA consistently outperforms traditional techniques in challenging scenarios, providing robust and interpretable low-dimensional representations even when scatter matrices are singular or ill-conditioned.

    "abstract": "With the deepening of electricity market reform, the transmission congestion management is critical for ensuring efficient market operations. Traditional transmission congestion management methods (e.g., proportional curtailment, price-based priority, and first-come-first-served) cannot accurately reflect the actual social welfare differences arising from different transactions, often leading to increased congestion costs and large fluctuations in locational marginal prices (LMPs). To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved model based on the social welfare congestion factor (SWCF). By quantitatively evaluating the economic benefit and network interaction strength of each transaction unit, the proposed approach seeks to maximize overall system social welfare under congested conditions. Simulations conducted on the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that compared to conventional approaches, our model can enhance social welfare by 3.8%–13.6%, reduce congestion costs by approximately 18%, and suppress LMP volatility by 25% in different congestion scenarios. Therefore, our study presents a novel perspective for congestion management of multi-channel transactions between regional electricity markets."

    "abstract": "Turbine engines need guide vane mechanism to have the performances of fast response and high reliability, so it is of great significance for the spool valve used in the mechanism. The article presents a new spool valve with hydraulic restrictor bridge as a pilot-stage, which consists of piezoelectrically-driven variable restrictor and fixed restrictor. Principles of four types of half bridge are introduced, and the flow gain and pressure gain of a particular half bridge are modeled and simulated. Characteristics of three types of full bridge, are analyzed and the pressure-flow characteristic of a particular full bridge for the spool valve are examined through AMESim simulation. Influences of main parameters in the restrictor bridge on response ability of the valve are analyzed. The results show that, the half bridge features a fixed restrictor at the oil inlet and a variable restrictor has larger gain and enough stability margin. The full bridge including three fixed restrictors and a variable restrictor has fewer fixed restrictors and higher resolution, and exhibits better displacement and speed response of the spool valve under different diameters of the restrictor. 1.5 mm diameter fixed restrictor can provide the best response for the spool valve. It can be recommended as a scheme solution for pilot-stage bridge in guide vane mechanism."

    "abstract": "Infrared imagery is essential for pedestrian detection in autonomous vehicles, especially in low-light and occluded environments where conventional RGB-based methods fall short. This research enhances pedestrian detection by incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) within a ResNet-50 backbone coupled with the Faster R-CNN model. CBAM improves the model's ability to concentrate on crucial spatial and channel features, which is particularly useful under challenging conditions like occlusions. Experiments conducted on the FLIR dataset reveal that the CBAM-enhanced Faster R-CNN achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) improvement from 0.8505 to 0.8717, reflecting an approximate 2.5% gain. Moreover, the model demonstrated stronger robustness under occluded pedestrian scenarios. These findings suggest that integrating CBAM significantly enhances the reliability of pedestrian detection systems in real-world applications. The results highlight a promising standalone infrared solution that eliminates reliance on RGB fusion, thereby offering a simpler, cost-effective, and more consistent alternative. This improvement supports safer and more dependable autonomous vehicle performance across variable environmental conditions."

    "abstract": "Interpreting motor imagery (MI) tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems remains a significant challenge in both neuroscience research and clinical applications. One of the challenges in MI classification tasks is finding an easily handled Electroencephalogram (EEG) representation method that can preserve both temporal and spatial features. In this study, we suggest a compact Convolutional Transformer to combine global and local characteristics into a single EEG classification system. This architecture starts with the feature extraction module-based Convolution block and adaptive feature recalibration (AFR). In particular, throughout the one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers, the convolution module picks up low-level local characteristics, and the AFR can improve the quality of the extracted features by modeling the inter-dependencies between the features. The global correlation within the local temporal features is extracted by simply connecting the self-attention module. Subsequently, the LightGBM classifier module is used to predict the categories for EEG data trained on the extracted features. Finally, we have carried out comprehensive tests to evaluate our approach on the publicly available BCI Competition IV 2a dataset in EEG-based motor imagery and emotion identification procedures. The experimental results indicate the potential of this approach for advancing BCI systems, achieving an accuracy of 74.73%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous advanced zero-shot and few-shot algorithms have been developed; however, their performance varies significantly across different environments. The lack of a standardized benchmark impedes the development and practical application of image anomaly detection (IAD) methods in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, without a uniform benchmark, researchers encounter difficulties conducting effective analyses of these algorithms. Consequently, this paper aims to establish a comprehensive benchmark for image anomaly detection, evaluating zero-shot and few-shot image classification models. This benchmark illustrates anomaly classification performance across varying threshold values for different models, tested on major datasets, utilizing consistent metrics and conditions. Additionally, this paper explores new methods to improve model performance. Specifically, we propose integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into conventional models. LoRA facilitates the adaptation of large and complex machine learning models for specific applications by introducing lightweight components to the original architecture, rather than necessitating a complete overhaul of the model. In the 8-shot setting on the MVTec-AD dataset, the CLIP-LoRA model achieves an AUROC of 79.9% and an F1-max of 85.5%, while the DINOv2-LoRA model attains an AUROC of 79.3% and an F1-max of 88.5%.

This challenge primarily arises from the circular trajectory exhibited by the fingertips during parallel grasping. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel design for an adaptive gripper that combines both linear parallel grasping and adaptive grasping functions. Specifically, on the one hand, the characteristics of a locust linkage mechanism are utilized to achieve linear motion of the fingertips. On the other hand, a two-stage parallel four-bar linkage mechanism is applied to the gripper to ensure a fixed posture of the terminal finger segments. Additionally, an idle stroke transmission mechanism with delayed triggering is employed to achieve an adaptive grasping effect. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robotic hand exhibits excellent grasping performance and is suitable for industrial grasping applications."

    "abstract": "The lack of clean drinking water is hurting a lot of people nowadays across various regions of the globe. Thus, there is a necessity of measuring the water quality. The goal of the paper is to create a machine learning water quality model. It is a data cleaning step followed by a feature selection process based on a Random Forest (RF) classifier and performance optimization through grid search and K-fold cross-validation. The overall goal is to predict the water quality correctly using the necessary characteristics like pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Carbonate (CO3), Bicarbonate (HCO3), Chloride (Cl), and Fluoride (F). The integrity- and consistency-based process of water quality compilation and recording comes first. The RF classifier is used to select the most important attributes that affect water quality and to select them. Then, the chosen features are trained to the RF model and hyperparameters are optimized by the grid search technique. In order to make the system user-friendly and accessible, a web application that allows the users to input the parameters and get real-time classification results is created. Although the model is very accurate, there are issues with it, including possible bias due to missing value imputation, seasonal water quality fluctuations, and noise in measurements. These we will address in subsequent work with more advanced imputation, temporal modeling, and noise-handling techniques to put greater emphasis on reliability. The model proposed can be put to use in monitoring and control of water quality by environmental scientists, water quality managers and ordinary people."

    "abstract": "Memristor is a nonvolatile memory structure that can be utilized in various applications such large-scale memory system and analog computing. By incorporating material that sensitive to external stimuli, the functionality of the memristor can be enhanced for realization of low-power smart sensor. Graphene has been extensively investigated as sensor material. In this work, a memristor structure with graphene as top electrode was considered. The memristor device was fabricated on an inexpensive copper clad substrate. The formation of copper oxide as the insulator layer was achieved by thermal oxidation on hot plate or oxidation in sodium hydroxide solutions. The graphene top electrode was formed by stencil printing. The oxidation process using sodium hydroxide produced darker surface, which indicates the formation of tenorite layer. Higher resistance value reflects the formation of insulator layer. Furthermore, oxidation using sodium hydroxide is suitable for the common copper clad as the process can be done at lower temperature. Based on current-voltage characteristics, the high-resistance state (HRS) and lowresistance state (LRS) could be observed. HRS-to-LRS ratio was calculated to be 1.15. The resistive switching of the fabricated device was also verified through observation of device resistance switching after DC biasing. Although the HRS-to-LRS ratio is relatively low, the obtained results demonstrated the functionality of the fabricated memristor."

    "abstract": "Requirement validation in software requirement engineering is a stage to check whether the specified system requirements are in accordance with customer needs. The consistency check of software requirements is one of the key activities during the requirement validation stage. This activity is generally performed manually by analysts, but it can now be automated using various approaches. However, several issues remain in consistency check activity such as: 1) many inconsistency detection studies remain at the syntactic level; 2) the use of static ontologies that cause limitations in handling system change dynamics; and 3) there has been no research on inconsistency detection of software requirements in requirement boilerplates pattern. Therefore, automation of inconsistency detection in requirement boilerplates dynamic ontology offers a promising solution to facilitate consistency checking. This study solves these problems by building a dynamic ontology-based requirement inconsistency detection software by detecting ontology inconsistencies using the HermiT reasoner and matches ontology components with requirement sentences using SPARQL queries. The test results show a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.92, based on reasoning and SPARQL querying over a pre-built dynamic requirement boilerplates ontology. By automating this method through a proof-of-concept software implementation, the process of detecting inconsistencies in requirement boilerplates sentences is expected to become more efficient and accurate."

By controlling the DC-side electrolytic capacitor voltage to remain balanced, common-mode leakage current can be eliminated. Compared to traditional half-bridge Buck-Boost inverters, the SIBBI uses only one inductor for energy regulation, thereby improving the utilisation rate of the inductor during both positive and negative half-cycles, reducing losses and costs, and further enhancing power density. The SIBBI employs a multi-modal control algorithm based on dead-beat control (DBC), ensuring that only one switch is in the high-frequency state at any given time, thereby reducing switching losses. Additionally, when the capacitance of the electrolytic capacitor decreases, the SIBBI can operate in pure Buck-Boost mode, thereby extending the lifespan of the electrolytic capacitor. This makes it suitable for photovoltaic inverter applications."

By exploiting the high-frequency sub-bands in the DWT domain, the proposed method embeds a color cover image with a binary secret image. A CNN was used to create a spatial heatmap of the cover image to identify regions that are less sensitive to light. This spatial function is similar to a soft threshold or mask that adjusts the embedding strength as necessary. During the extraction stage, the hidden secret is reassembled using the differences between the stego and cover wavelet coefficients. In the experiments, our method outperformed the DWT method in terms of produced stego image quality (PSNR > 44 dB, SSIM > 0.98), as well as of successfully extracting the hidden image (NC > 0.94, BER < 7%). The proposed system is found to be more robust and secure than traditional approaches, thanks to efficient heatmap generation. This makes it particularly suitable for image-based secure communication."

Product images must capture fine details, maintain global structural consistency, and align accurately with textual descriptions. To address these needs, we propose RADT (Region-Aware Diffusion Transformer), a diffusion framework tailored for consumer electronics image generation. RADT integrates a Region-Aware Attention (RAA) mechanism into the denoising process. It introduces a dynamic neighborhood window that adjusts to feature complexity, allowing better preservation of local details in electronic products. In addition, RADT employs multi-scale feature aggregation, enabling information sharing across different resolutions and strengthening global structural fidelity. The optimization process is further improved with a dynamically weighted MSE objective, which balances the importance of denoising steps, focusing on structural recovery at early stages and detail refinement at later stages. Together, these innovations make RADT an effective solution for text-guided consumer electronics image generation, providing both methodological contributions and practical value for product design, visualization, and marketing. Experimental results show that RADT can generate images of consumer electronics with superior fidelity, semantic alignment, and structural realism."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the simultaneous localization problem of multiple magnetic dipole sources distributed at varying heights in space. To overcome the limitations of traditional optimization-based methods, which are time-consuming and prone to local optima, we propose a fast multi-dipole linear localization (MDLL) method. After performing 2D grid measurements, the MDLL method first determines the number of magnetic sources, their initial positions, and magnetic moments by calculating the magnetic gradient tensor and tilt angle. It then filters effective measurement points for each source using the Voronoi diagram and iteratively refines the results through a single-source linear localization scheme to approach the true values. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the MDLL method significantly outperforms the benchmark one-step localization (OSL) and differential evolution (DE) methods in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency. In noise-free simulations, the localization error of MDLL is reduced by over 99% compared to OSL and DE, and its computation speed is more than 20,000 times faster than DE in the scenario with 30 magnetic sources, with the advantage becoming more evident as the number of sources increases. In experiment, the average localization error of MDLL are only 4.55% and 36.94% of that of OSL and DE methods, respectively, and its computation time remains significantly shorter than that of the DE method."
