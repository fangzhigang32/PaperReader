    "abstract": "Future wireless networks are anticipated to evolve by aerial communication platforms. Nonetheless, the operational lifespan and efficacy of transceivers such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are strictly prohibited by their constrained onboard power sources. This paper focuses on an aerial network configuration where a UAV harvests solar power to serve energy-limited IoT devices through simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In this setup, the UAV and the IoT devices, each are equipped with energy and data buffers. This system also benefits from rate splitting multiple access for efficient interference management. Upon optimizing the system efficacy, we formulate a long-term resource allocation problem to maximize the time-averaged energy efficiency. To address this stochastic and non-convex optimization problem, we propose a multi-stage solution strategy. Firstly, by leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we transform the long-term stochastic problem into an equivalent deterministic short-term form. Next, by recasting this equivalent problem into Markov decision process, we propose a resource allocation mechanism based on actor-critic hindsight experience replay (AC-HER), tailored to capture the problem dynamics and optimize its variables. Moreover, given the UAV high mobility and the system reconfigurations, we fortify the trained AC-HER model with meta-learning strategy, enhancing its adaptability to system variations. Simulations verified that the proposed resource allocation strategy considerably outperforms its counterparts."

    "abstract": "Systems relying on ML have become ubiquitous, but so has biased behavior within them. Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust in systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different backgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models' behavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey explainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics. We conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of the-art visualization tools (LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how taxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for non-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between comprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they trust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is strongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations increase people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces trust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability visualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show that visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension, increase perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model bias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design, significantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work advances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically investigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have recently shown remarkable success in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). However, their applications, in practice, still face two significant challenges. First, although the multihead mechanism in self-attention improves model robustness during training, it may overlook the continuity of spectral bands. Second, existing methods often struggle to effectively balance global and local information during multiscale feature extraction, limiting further improvements in classification performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral-guided multiscale feature-aware Transformer (SMFAT) framework for HSIC. Specifically, a global low-rank spectral learning (GLSL) module is introduced to project hyperspectral image patches into a low-rank subspace, reducing spectral redundancy and capturing global spectral correlations. Furthermore, we introduce the multiscale feature-aware self-attention (MFASA) mechanism, which dynamically integrates fine- and coarse-grained features to enhance multiscale feature modeling. Finally, a spectral-guided fusion (SGF) module leverages the global spectral information extracted by the GLSL module to guide MFASA in more effectively capturing interspectral correlations and spectral continuity. This approach facilitates a more effective integration of spectral and spatial features in HSIs. Experiments on three well-known HSI datasets verify that the proposed SMFAT method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in real-world HSIC tasks.

    "abstract": "Demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has surged across diverse domains. Because UAV systems are battery-powered, their available energy is limited, which in turn constrains transmit power and thus communication range. To mitigate these constraints, swarm UAVs—in which multiple UAVs cooperate to accomplish a mission—have attracted significant attention. In a swarm, multiple UAVs fly concurrently and perform tasks cooperatively; the operational area of each UAV is partitioned to minimize overlap. Consequently, swarms can systematically cover a wider area than a single UAV and increase mission throughput. However, in decentralized flying ad hoc network (FANET) environments, the large volume of UAV-to-UAV communications induces congestion, and mobility leads to high topological volatility, rendering links unstable. As a result, latency and packet loss may occur, making it difficult to guarantee quality of service (QoS). In centralized models proposed to address this issue, a cluster head manages communications. Because the cluster head consumes more energy than other UAVs, it has a shorter flight time. When the cluster head is replaced, the ensuing topology change degrades the overall network stability. To remedy the instability caused by rapid energy depletion of the cluster head, we propose a Cluster-Head-Based Cooperative Communications System (C3S) that leverages cooperative communications. C3S shares data with cooperative nodes and performs cooperative transmissions to reduce the energy consumption of the transmitting node, thereby balancing energy expenditure across cluster-head nodes and extending network lifetime. Moreover, C3S exploits temporal and spatial diversity gains to provide reliable communications at low transmit power."

    "abstract": "Multi-rotors have garnered significant attention in aerial robotics due to advances in versatile configurations and tilt mechanisms that enhance endurance, payload capacity, velocity, and agility. While these innovations improve energy efficiency and operational flexibility, they also introduce complex dynamics that challenge control design. Notable progress, such as the Gemini tilt bi-rotor, has refined bi-rotor architectures through extensive simulations and experimental validation. However, optimal configuration, accurate modeling, robust control frameworks, and practical implementation of tilt bi-rotors remain open research problems. This study proposes a model-based methodology for the design, modeling, and simulation of the Homma tilt bi-rotor, incorporating two distinct control strategies. A comprehensive dynamic and subsystem model is developed, accompanied by a trajectory-tracking control scheme, with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Sliding Mode (SM) controllers carefully designed and optimized to match the system's inherent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that both controllers achieve high tracking accuracy, with SM exhibiting superior robustness in handling the complex dynamics of tilt bi-rotors. This research underscores the potential of tilt birotor configurations and establishes a resilient control framework for their performance optimization. By integrating Model-in-the- Loop (MIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations with advanced flight control techniques, the study iteratively improves tilt bi-rotor performance through systematic controller development and rigorous flight testing."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable antennas (RAs) have been a pivotal technology due to their ability to dynamically adjust parameters. This paper underscores the critical need for the radio channel modeling—defined as an integrated framework that captures the full signal transmission chain, encompassing wireless propagation channel characteristics, transmitter antenna parameters, and receiver antenna responses, while quantifying their intrinsic coupling. This stands in contrast to traditional channel models, which treat antennas as ideal transducers and focus solely on the propagation medium, often overlooking the impact of antenna parameters. A measurement framework, featuring a custom-designed 28/5.3 GHz RA with reconfigurable cross-polarization ratio, isolation level, and voltage standing wave ratio, is established. Results from outdoor and indoor measurement scenarios are presented. Experimental analyses reveal that the influence of isolation levels varies significantly, with indoor environments at 28 GHz showing stronger sensitivity to isolation levels compared to outdoor settings. The paper further discusses radio channel modeling methods, including circuit-based, field-based, and unified field-circuit approaches, emphasizing their roles in bridging information theory and electromagnetic physics. Finally, the study identifies the distinctions between traditional and general antenna designs."

Using the characteristic electric field signatures of the tower-terminated lightning, we developed a machine learning approach to identify strikes to towers in large lightning datasets. The ground-truth data were acquired at the Lightning Observatory in Gainesville (LOG), Florida. The classification model used in this study is based on supervised multi-layer perceptron model, aiming to capture complex pulse patterns with the neural network architecture. The results show that tower-terminated lightning and non-tower-terminated lightning can be accurately identified. We found that the model performance depends on the configuration of the training dataset. Using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), we found that our machine learning model is capable of capturing the key features of electric field signatures produced by lightning strikes to tall towers."

    "abstract": "As oil and gas explorations progressively advance towards deeper and more complex geological formations, the imperative for precise characterization of subsurface structures has become increasingly prominent. The efficacy of noise suppression is a critical determinant for the quality of subsequent inversion and imaging processes. In recent years, deep learning methodologies have garnered significant attention and widespread application in seismic denoising, primarily due to their inherent data-driven advantages. While conventional deep learning implementations have achieved notable denoising performance, they are confronted with inherent limitations, including incomplete noise reduction and potential signal degradation. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative multi-round SCU-Net (MR-SCU) denoising approach. The MR-SCU methodology based on SCU-Net employs noise as labeled data to generate an initial denoised outcome in the first round. Denoising results are used as input while utilizing the residuals between the labeled and predicted data as labels for subsequent denoising round. Multiple rounds are iteratively repeated to achieve more thorough denoising effect while preserving effective signals from being compromised. The incorporation of SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) as the loss function further enhances the method’s precision in detail-oriented denoising tasks. Numerical experiments conducted on synthetic data and field data acquired from a specific region in western China substantiate the efficacy of the MR-SCU, demonstrating its capability to deliver superior denoising performance while optimally preserve valuable seismic information."

    "abstract": "Addressing the challenges of multi-energy systems in data collection and integration — such as heterogeneity, spatial disparities, and temporal scale mismatches—this paper investigates the characterization and modeling of renewable energy generation data. First, by modeling the principles and output characteristics of wind and photovoltaic power generation, we analyze their nonlinearity, non-smoothness, and multi-scale properties. To address the difficulty of extracting actionable insights directly from raw data, we introduce signal decomposition techniques and propose a refined analytical method for wind power daily profiles based on K-means clustering and variational mode decomposition (VMD). The K-means algorithm clusters wind power data into typical daily profiles, while VMD decomposes the signals, with the modal number K optimized via average sample entropy to precisely extract structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that this method improves data interpretability and enhances prediction accuracy. This study not only advances standardized processing methods for renewable energy data but also contributes to the development of a holistic \"source-grid-load\" energy data framework."

Existing methods suffer from semantic disconnect between encrypted payloads and threat behaviors, computational bottlenecks preventing real-time deployment, and inability to adapt to zero-day attacks. This paper introduces a unified framework integrating four complementary technologies: (1) LLM-inspired behavioral tokenization for encrypted payload analysis, (2) TCN-based temporal modeling with multi-scale dilated convolutions, (3) few-shot learning for rapid threat adaptation, and (4) high-throughput stream processing architecture. Our semantic-temporal hybrid approach achieves 96.1% detection accuracy with sub-10ms response latency, while the prototypical learning framework demonstrates 89.7% accuracy on zero-day attacks using only 10 labeled examples per category. Comprehensive evaluation across six datasets including UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IoT23 validates consistent improvements: 95.3% average accuracy and 60% latency reduction compared to LSTM-based approaches. This research bridges theoretical deep learning advances with practical encrypted traffic analysis requirements."

In order for the model to learn complicated spatiotemporal wildfire patterns, it incorporates crucial features like Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture. To improve the model's contextual understanding, RAG retrieves pertinent historical and geographical data, and SHO optimises the model's hyper parameters for efficient and robust training. A full suite of performance metrics is used to assess the model. The results show that the model performs exceptionally well in terms of prediction, with metrics such as Accuracy-93.40%, Precision-91.78%, Recall-88.96%, F1 Score-90.35%, AUC-ROC-96.04%, and IoU-81.71%. Visualisation outputs such as area under the curve (AUC-ROC), principal component analysis (PR) curves, loss trend plots, and feature importance plots offer explanations and useful information. Early warning systems, environmental monitoring, and disaster response planning have great potential for the proposed Flame RAGSHO architecture, which provides a robust and interpretable solution for real-time wildfire risk prediction."

In the proposed model, a Base Station (BS) transmits signals to NOMA users through a cluster of cooperative relays and EH-BD devices. EH-BD not only reflects signals to serve users but also harvests energy from the transmitted signals to maintain its operation. Furthermore, to enhance the system’s symbiotic performance, we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm based on power allocation for each user. Simulation results reveal that the energy efficiency and data transmission rate are improved considerably under various channel conditions. Finally, such a model has great potential for green communication systems due to its utilization of energy harvesting and symbiotic performance optimization, reducing dependence on traditional energy sources while maintaining high data transmission rates."

    "abstract": "In today's software-driven world, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) play a central role in enabling communication between different systems and services. To verify the functionality, reliability, and performance of these interfaces, testing procedures are carried out. Ensuring that API development and testing processes are conducted quickly, efficiently, and accurately is critical for delivering high-quality software services. The complex structure and limited features offered by existing API testing tools often reduces user experience and lead to time loss during the testing process. Moreover, these tools typically store test data on their own servers, posing a potential security risk by exposing sensitive and confidential company data. In this context, a need for a more comprehensive solution for API testing and management processes has emerged. No-code is an innovative approach that requires very little programming experience from the creator of an application, providing great convenience and time savings for developers. The aim of this study is to develop an API testing platform that addresses these needs while maximizing both security and functionality. To achieve this, a no-code API test platform called \"Atlas\" has been developed. The platform has been designed as a desktop solution using Electron, with the user interface builted in React. The back end utilized Node.js for automatic updates and version control, and Couchbase has been selected as the database. The platform provided a customizable framework that aligned with corporate requirements and demonstrated the effectiveness of creating codeless API testing. With the developed platform, it has reduced both cost and security-related risks."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges posed by the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of sample data in water quality assessment in arid regions of Northwest China, this study proposes a comprehensive water quality evaluation framework based on Projection Pursuit (PP) theory. The framework incorporates a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the optimal projection direction, thereby establishing a PSO-based projection pursuit model for integrated water quality assessment. Taking representative cross-sections of river basins in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as the study area, a water quality evaluation system comprising nine key indicators was developed. This system enables effective dimensionality reduction and comprehensive analysis of multidimensional water quality data. When analyzing both comprehensive and individual evaluation indicators, the proposed model effectively distinguishes water quality conditions across different sections and quantifies the influence of each indicator on overall water quality. The case study demonstrates that the PSO-based projection pursuit model effectively addresses the issues of nonlinearity and high dimensionality in water quality assessment, showing strong applicability and potential for broader implementation in water quality evaluation across arid river basins in Northwest China."

To validate the performance, actual temperature data from Seoul, South Korea, was used. The system failure rates and reliability were analyzed using both the conventional failure rate method and LSTM-based predictions of operating temperature. Furthermore, the predicted temperatures were compared with actual measured values to assess the accuracy of the prediction model. The analysis results show that the LSTM-based approach predicts the system reliability to reach 0.5 after approximately 14 years of operation, which is about 12.5% lower than the result obtained using the conventional static method based on average failure rates. Moreover, when compared with the reliability evaluated using actual measured temperature data, the prediction error of the LSTM-based approach was found to be less than 1%, demonstrating high accuracy. These findings indicate that incorporating time-varying thermal stress information enables more precise and realistic reliability assessments that closely reflect actual operating conditions."

We demonstrate that integrating structured visual relationship modeling with adaptive attention mechanisms enables hierarchical fusion of cross-modal features. To this end, we propose a lightweight architecture that captures multi-order dependencies among visual entities through sparse graph computations. We develop a dynamically parameterized bilinear attention mechanism that performs language-conditioned feature recalibration, enhancing semantic specificity in visual representations. Our framework jointly processes visual and textual inputs through parallel relational reasoning and attention pathways, enabling cross-modal feature integration for precise answer inference."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods used in blockchain systems face increasing risk. One such area of concern is the Layer-2 protocols zk-Rollups designed to improve scalability and privacy in platforms like Ethereum, which are heavily dependent on classical zero-knowledge proofs such as zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. These systems may be compromised by quantum algorithms. To address this, we propose a quantum-secure zk-Rollup model using Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proofs (QZKPs), implemented with IBM’s Qiskit simulator. The protocol uses quantum features like superposition and random basis selection to verify transactions without leaking private data. Simulation results confirm key properties: valid proofs are reliably accepted, while invalid ones are rejected. This demonstrates both the feasibility and future relevance of integrating QZKPs into blockchain systems for post-quantum security."

However, although the second-order mathematical model is well known, parameter identification is required for each motor, both because the physical characteristics vary among motors and because these parameters change over time. Once the parameters are obtained, a control can be applied. This work presents the identification of six parameters for a DC motor using recurrent neural networks. The implemented mathematical model uses measurable system data, including current, input voltage, and angular velocity, to estimate electrical resistance, inductance, electromagnetic torque, viscous friction, and inertia. These estimations were validated through simulations and comparison with measured data. The results showed that the parameters were estimated with 99% accuracy."

A robust adaptive filtering algorithm based on prediction residuals is proposed. By constructing a state vector containing altitude and velocity, the algorithm adaptively adjusts the noise covariance matrices according to the prediction residuals. An adaptive learning factor is then introduced to regulate the weighting between predicted and observed values, improving estimation accuracy. Compared to the Kalman Filter (KF) method, the proposed algorithm does not require precise prior covariance information and achieves faster responsiveness with lower estimation latency. The proposed algorithm was evaluated against complementary filtering (CF), Kalman filtering (KF), and unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) methods using experimental UAV flight data. Under identical initialization parameters, it achieved a 9.2%-13.2% reduction in altitude estimation RMSE compared to these classical algorithms."

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces an RUL prediction framework that leverages full-frequency-band degradation feature extraction combined with adaptive feedback-based fusion. First, a 1/3 binary tree filtering strategy is used to perform multi-scale decomposition of the vibration signals, and the Wasserstein distance (WD) is employed to extract full-frequency-band degradation features. Next, a dynamic feedback mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust Health Indicators (HI). Experimental results on the XJTU-SY dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method."

A sentiment classifier based on Indonesian RoBERTa was employed to process and track shifts in 2,700 user comments. The sentiment analysis showed that premature marketing and star-centric promotions fostered predominantly positive and neutral sentiments, suggesting cautious optimism and anticipated hype. In contrast, release period comments showed a significant spike in negative sentiment, demonstrating pervasive disenchantment due to a disconnect between expectations and the film's narrative style execution. The research highlights the marketing enigma where promotional activities disconnect with reception, revealing the friction between content strategies tailored to audience expectations within the starkly horror genre, famous for its suspenseful pacing.

    "abstract": "The healthy operation of electromechanical system products is closely related to the safety of aircraft, and accurate fault diagnosis is one of the key core technologies in order to ensure their high availability, high mission safety and reliability. However, the low and unbalanced failure rate of aircraft electromechanical products leads to the challenges of scarce samples and the high cost of data annotation for fault diagnosis. To address this question, this study proposes a diagnosis-aware active learning (DAAL) method based on uncertainty metrics, introduces an active learning strategy, trains the ranker to capture the diagnostic uncertainty of unlabelled samples by designing the ranking loss and embedding it in a hidden code, and perceives the diagnostic information by using a task-independent active learning model, so as to filter out the unlabelled data that are both informative and high-impact in terms of diagnostic uncertainty metrics, finally achieving efficient data labelling."

    "abstract": "The most recent trend is storing vast quantities of raw and unstructured data. Nonetheless, this still places enormous challenges on the quality and reliability of the data in these lakes to support data warehousing pipelines. Any inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated data used in business analytics can produce incorrect insights and decisions, resulting in potential losses for organizations. So, it is essential to enforce data quality and make sure data warehousing pipelines are operating to their best by introducing data lake validation best practices. A critical approach that is often used is data profiling, where we analyze the data to detect patterns, relationships, and anomalies. This is the main reason why it is always a good practice to review the data first since this enables data engineers to gather information about the nature of the data and see its quality. Moreover, data can be cleaned by using techniques to find and correct errors in data, such as missing data or inconsistencies. The reason is that this step allows for the cleansing of data and ultimately ensures that downstream data processing can be done accurately."

This study proposes a precise and computationally efficient SOH estimation method based on four years of operational data from nine electric vehicles. First, battery interval capacity is estimated from charging segments in the raw dataset to generate SOH labels. Then, 15 candidate features encompassing battery characteristics, driving habits, and climate conditions are extracted, with 12 selected for SOH estimation. Finally, seven machine learning models are evaluated, with LightGBM chosen as the optimal model for mapping features to SOH. Cross-validation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an MAE of 2% in SOH estimation."

AEMNC-ASGN focuses on solving the problem of low attack success rate under perturbation concealment constraints in time series data attacks. Firstly, the SE attention mechanism is embedded in the generator to learn the key perturbation regions. Secondly, dual-discriminator co-architecture of SEResNet and ResNeXt50 is constructed in the discriminator, and the generator is guided to mine the cross-model common blind spots to enhance the adversarial sample aggressiveness. Thirdly, the composite loss function of the proposed L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>−L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>−L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</inf> norms is integrated into the loss function to constrain the perturbation strength to enhance the concealment of the adversarial sample. Comparative simulations on a traction motor fault diagnosis model show that the adversarial samples generated by AEMNC-ASGN significantly enhance the attack efficacy under the perturbation amplitude constraints compared to the existing methods."

The model was trained on the Google Colab platform and various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, such as Xception, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, MobileNet and EfficientNetB0, were compared using an 80:20 training:testing split. Regularization techniques were employed during the training process to prevent overfitting. The Xception architecture achieved the highest accuracy (Acc) (98.83%) and F1 (98.82%). The developed model is integrated with a web-based user interface that enables physicians to upload MRI images and quickly obtain predictions in a user-friendly manner.

The paper is a thorough comparison of four common methods of detection which include a cough sound analysis, clinical evaluation of symptoms, a chest X-ray, and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The modalities are compared based on the diagnostic accuracy, their availability, and deployability to the resource limited settings. The improvement in artificial intelligence and machine learning allowed a meaningful extraction of acoustics and visually based biomarkers, particularly in cough and CT-based diagnostics. The widespread use of symptom checkers and imaging methods still faces problems in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, standardizing data and data collection ethically. The review also notes the recent advances in deep learning architecture such as COVID-CTNet and COVNet and recommends a way forward to combine multi-modal diagnostic approach. This chapter sums up limitations that need to be overcome at the moment along with the most important directions of the future studies related to COVID-19 detection."

    "abstract": "A metabolic disorder, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), where the human body unable to utilize and store glucose properly, results from chronically increased blood glucose (BG) levels. In particular, human body has a limited ability to generate enough insulin in order to control the BG levels and ensure homeostasis due to increased insulin resistance and/or reduced pancreatic secretion. Insulin Sensitivity (SI) is a glycaemic control biomarker indicating increased insulin resistance via lower values. This study uses a machine learning (ML) classification technique to generate insight in linking a SI with BG performance in T2D individuals. The main objective is to develop a machine learning program to make an early prediction for T2D by linking SI with BG level. An artificial neural network (ANN) is employed with a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training model and data from a series of Dynamics Insulin Sensitivity and Secretion Test (DISST) results. The correlation of SI as well as BG results achieved 88.89% accuracy in predicting a T2D patient compared to a non-diagnosed individual. The SI value calculated from DISST model is comparable with the HOMA model. This method and resulting ANN model can be used to help predict patient condition more accurately."

In response to these challenges, an innovative smart cane has been proposed, developed, and tested. The cane has built-in obstacle detection, and a fall detection system with auto-emergency notification alert and GPS for navigational assistance. A user-friendly mobile application is designed and it is connected to the cane via Bluetooth. The mobile application is created with Kodular and it allows simple interaction using swipe and tap gestures and includes text-to-speech option. It also supports customizable fonts and high contrast visual themes. Users can locate facilities such as toilets or bus stops through the app, improving independence, equality, and sense of security. The cane consists of a fall detector that employs Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, which trigger GPS navigation and WhatsApp based emergency notifications through Bluetooth to emergency contacts. The emergency button on the cane can be manually pressed and it produces an alarming sound and grabs attention of the surrounding people to the users. Therefore, the proposed cane and app can gain independency, support security, and achieve SDG Goal 3 to enhance good health, well-being and SDG Goal 10 to reduce inequalities."

    "abstract": "The traditional genetic algorithm tends to fall into local optimality when solving large scale satellite mission planning problem, which makes it difficult to attain better planning results. The improvement of the algorithm's optimization search capability for higher gains in satellite observation missions is of great research interest. In this paper, a new hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed for the comprehensive optimization of the multi-objective satellite mission planning problem to maximize the satellite observation gain while minimizing the energy consumption of the satellites. An integer coding method is designed in the algorithm for the characteristics of satellite mission planning. The algorithm adopts a hybrid initialization method to improve the quality of the initial population while maintaining the diversity of the initial population. The adaptive genetic variation method and simulated annealing elite selection strategy are used in the evolutionary process of the algorithm. The combination of the global optimality-seeking ability of the genetic algorithm and the local optimality-seeking ability of the simulated annealing algorithm improves the optimality-seeking ability; the possibility of the algorithm falling into a local optimum is reduced by the adaptive mutation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the hybrid genetic algorithm is verified through experiments."

This approach enables the reuse of most precomputed data from the original structure, necessitating only localized re-computation for the modified region. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant speedups over conventional fast integral-equation solvers in handling PMs, making it a promising tool for the rapid analysis and design of FPSs."

    "abstract": "Accurate shape reconstruction is essential for precise control and reliable operation of soft robots. Compared to sensor-based approaches, vision-based methods offer advantages in cost, simplicity, and ease of deployment. However, existing vision-based methods often rely on complex camera setups, specific backgrounds, or large-scale training datasets, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a vision-based, markerless, and training-free framework for soft robotic shape reconstruction that directly leverages the natural surface appearance of the robot. These surface features act as implicit visual markers, enabling a hierarchical matching strategy that decouples local partition alignment from global kinematic optimization. Requiring only an initial 3D reconstruction and kinematic alignment, our method achieves real-time shape tracking across diverse environments while maintaining robustness to occlusions and variations in camera viewpoints. Experimental validation on a continuum soft robot demonstrates an average tip error of 2.6% during real-time operation, as well as stable performance in practical closed-loop control tasks. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for reliable, low-cost deployment in dynamic real-world settings."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology presents promising prospects for improving spectral efficiency, enabling hardware resource sharing, and facilitating novel application scenarios. Nevertheless, the mutual interference between communication and sensing remains a critical barrier to overcome. As an effective interference management solution, both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) demonstrate unique advantages in interference suppression, which are expected to substantially enhance the overall performance of ISAC systems. To this end, the design options of NOMA versus RSMA for the ISAC systems are investigated in this paper. Furthermore, due to the inherent complexities in both signal propagation characteristics and receiver processing architectures, channel estimation errors (CEEs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) are incorporated during system modeling. Against the above background, the communication and sensing performance of the NOMA and RSMA ISAC systems is analyzed by respectively deriving the exact and asymptotic outage probabilities (OPs) and ergodic rates (ERs) for the users, the probability of detection (PoD) for the base station and Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). The numerical results demonstrate that RSMA outperforms NOMA in terms of OPs, ERs, PoD, and CRB."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the state constraint control problem of ammunition loading manipulator arms (ALMA) with nonlinear friction, saturation, and external disturbances by using prescribed performance control (PPC) and backstepping. The traditional exponential function in traditional PPC is replaced by a hyperbolic tangent function to improve convergence speed and make convergence time controllable. A fragility-preventing coefficient is introduced into the PPC framework to reduce saturation. Meanwhile, a continuous Gaussian error function is employed to approximate the control quantity affected by the nonlinearity resulting from saturation, thus the error problem caused by saturation is solved. Moreover, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are used to estimate nonlinear friction and unmolded dynamics, and adaptive laws are implemented to mitigate the influence of external disturbances on the motor and load side. The closed-loop system is proven to be semi-globally uniform stable, and the tracking error can converge to a neighborhood of origin within a given performance bound in all cases. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is widely applied in cryptography, coding theory, and signal processing. It has been extended to the multidimensional CRT (MD-CRT), which reconstructs an integer vector from its vector remainders modulo multiple integer matrices. This paper investigates a generalized MD-CRT for multiple integer vectors, where the goal is to determine multiple integer vectors from multiple vector residue sets modulo multiple integer matrices. Comparing to the existing generalized CRT for multiple scalar integers, the challenge is that the moduli in MD-CRT are matrices that do not commute and the corresponding uniquely determinable range is multidimensional and the inclusion relationship is much more complicated. In this paper, we address two fundamental questions regarding the generalized MD-CRT. The first question concerns the uniquely determinable range of multiple integer vectors when no prior information about them is available. The second question is about the conditions under which the maximal possible dynamic range can be achieved. To answer these two questions, we first derive a uniquely determinable range without prior information and accordingly propose an algorithm to achieve it. A special case involving only two integer vectors is investigated for the second question, leading to a new condition for achieving the maximal possible dynamic range. Interestingly, this newly obtained condition, when the dimension is reduced to 1, is even better than the existing ones for the conventional generalized CRT for scalar integers. These results may have applications for frequency detection in multidimensional signal processing."

    "abstract": "Weather forecasting is an essential aspect of climate-sensitive industries like agriculture, water resources management, and disaster risk management. Short-range forecasts enable prompt decision-making, whereas medium-range and long-range predictions are imperative for strategic decision-making and policy formulation. Traditional forecasting models have a tendency to fail in detecting the intricate, non-linear, and scale-dependent processes inherent in meteorological records. Although classical models are capable of providing some level of predictability, they tend to lack in describing temporal dynamics and nonlinear relationships of meteorological information. Deep learning is increasingly becoming an influential alternative because it has the capability of sequence dependency modelling and spatial-temporal patterns modelling. This research deals with the issue of enhancing multi-scale weather forecasts using sophisticated neural architectures. Particularly, it compares and examines LSTM, LSTM-CNN, and LSTM-Transformer models for temperature, humidity, and rainfall forecasting at different time resolutions. Real-time weather data for Chennai between 2000 and 2025 were retrieved through the Open-Meteo API. The data were resampled into daily, weekly, and monthly scales, normalized, and fed into awalk-forward validation process. Each model was tuned with Keras Tuner and tested with different metrics. Findings indicate that LSTM-CNN has the best performance for short-term forecasting because it can learn local patterns, and LSTM-Transformer is best suited for long-range forecasting with global attention mechanisms. Rainfall, because it’s bursty, still proves to be the hardest parameter to accurately model. The research finds that architecture choice should be dependent on the forecast horizon, and that hybrid models are promising candidates for improving accuracy and scalability. These results support the creation of intelligent, geographically specific climate forecasting systems for climate-resilient decision-making. These insights can directly support agricultural scheduling and water resource planning, offering region-specific decision support for climate resilience."

    "abstract": "With the increasing sophistication of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), the demand for effective detection and mitigation strategies and methods has escalated. Program execution leaves traces in the system audit log, which can be analyzed to detect malicious activities. However, collecting and analyzing large volumes of audit logs over extended periods is challenging, further compounded by insufficient labeling that hinders their usability. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces SAGA (Synthetic Audit log Generation for APT campaigns), a novel approach for generating find-grained labeled synthetic audit logs that mimic real-world system logs while embedding stealthy APT attacks. SAGA generates configurable audit logs for arbitrary duration, blending benign logs from normal operations with malicious logs based on the definitions the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Malicious audit logs follow an APT lifecycle, incorporating various attack techniques at each stage. These synthetic logs can serve as benchmark datasets for training machine learning models and assessing diverse APT detection methods. To demonstrate the usefulness of synthetic audit logs, we ran established baselines of event-based technique hunting and APT campaign detection using various synthetic audit logs. In addition, we show that a deep learning model trained on synthetic audit logs can detect previously unseen techniques within audit logs."

    "abstract": "In the initial design stage of a Surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (SPMSM), it is necessary to analyze characteristic parameters according to key geometric design variables using either analytical method or Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The Analytical Method (AM) has the advantage of fast computation and the ability to generate large-scale data, but it has limitations in accurately reflecting nonlinear characteristics that vary with geometric design parameters. Therefore, to achieve more accurate predictions FEA must be performed. However, it involves high computational cost and long analysis time. To address this trade-off, this study proposes a predictive framework based on transfer learning, in which a deep neural network is pre-trained using AM-generated data and fine-tuned with a limited amount of FEA data. The proposed method takes advantage of AM to rapidly generate a large dataset for initial training of the deep learning model, followed by transfer learning using a small number of FEA-labeled samples to improve prediction accuracy while minimizing computational burden. The proposed method can quickly and accurately estimate the electromagnetic characteristics according to the geometric and physical design variables of the SPMSM, and it has been confirmed that it effectively reduces motor property computation time by complementarily leveraging the strengths and limitations of both AM and FEA."

    "abstract": "Matrix factorization is a fundamental characterization model in machine learning and is usually solved using mathematical decomposition reconstruction loss. However, matrix factorization is a data-driven model whose results depend on data quality, making it susceptible to noise. Inspired by physics, the law of conservation of energy is used to introduce physical laws into matrix factorization, which is called Physics-informed Matrix Factorization operator (PiMF). The PiMF operator uses the heat conduction equation to construct the energy objective function for matrix factorization, thereby retaining the mathematical model's decomposition meaning and satisfying the interpretability of physics. The PiMF follows the physical laws, thereby suppressing irregular or sudden noise signals that violate these physical principles. The solutions of the PiMF operator include more comprehensive knowledge of mathematics and physics, which improves the ability to generalize complex data, especially for noisy data. We demonstrate the consistency of the energy objective function and the mathematical model, which verifies the feasibility of matrix factorization using physical energy laws. In addition, the physical interpretability of the PiMF operator is proved from the perspective of energy decline. This study proposes two practical algorithms for PiMF in classification and clustering tasks, enhancing the practicability of matrix factorization by incorporating task-specific prior information constraints. The experimental results of PiMF for classification and clustering demonstrate the advantages of the proposed operator. The importance of physics-informed matrix factorization is verified, especially for noisy data."

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of sea surface temperature (SST) is highly important for climate change research and the management of marine ecosystems. Traditional numerical models rely on complex physical processes and precise initial conditions, resulting in high computational costs and limited generalizability. Although deep learning methods can improve the physical consistency and interpretability of ocean processes by incorporating physical constraints, their performance may degrade under anomalous or extreme SST conditions, where rigid constraints limit the model’s adaptability to complex variations. In contrast, incorporating motion-aware mechanisms enables models to flexibly capture dynamic patterns from data, thus increasing their responsiveness to nonstationary processes. Therefore, we propose a novel SST prediction model that integrates optical flow guidance with spatiotemporal awareness, aiming to enhance the modeling of motion and spatiotemporal features in SST evolution. The proposed model consists of three key modulesa spatiotemporal information extraction module (SIEM), a motion trend extraction module (MTEM), and a spatiotemporal feature fusion module (SFFM). First, the SIEM, composed of multiple layers of SwinLSTM, captures spatial and temporal dependencies in the SST time series. The MTEM then estimates the optical flow to extract motion information from the SST data. Finally, the motion information is used to dynamically adjust the spatiotemporal features, which are then fused in the SFFM. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conducted SST prediction experiments at both daily (1–10 days) and weekly (1–10 weeks) scales over the South China Sea (SCS) and the Pacific Ocean, and compared the results with several existing models. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics, with superior prediction accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "Virtual Prototypes (VPs) are important tools in modern hardware development. At high abstractions, they are often implemented in SystemC and offer early analysis of increasingly complex designs. These complex designs often combine one or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in hardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a well-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction levels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be seamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in the SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches modify and replace the SystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely, and would not allow focussing on special challenges of particular subsystems like peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a versatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC kernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our extensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different levels of abstractions. Both tools’ extensive sets of features are demonstrated for (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In comparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel and peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level Modelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling cross-level verification with symbolic execution."

However, its spatial variability and dominant environmental drivers across China's river basins remain unclear, posing challenges for basin-scale management. In this study, a comprehensive WUE analysis framework was established through the integration of multi-source remote sensing and auxiliary datasets. In this framework, multi-source vegetation, climate, topography, and land-use data were integrated to estimate WUE from the GPP-to-ET ratio, and a novel basin-scale dataset covering 25 major river basins in China from 2002 to 2021 was generated (CBS-WUE, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17402779), which was validated against FLUXNET2015 observations. With this new dataset, inter-basin comparisons were conducted to characterize spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, while multivariate statistical and machine learning analyses were employed to identify the relative contributions of climatic, biotic, and land-use drivers. Results indicated that elevation and vegetation structure were the primary factors influencing basin-scale WUE differences. The national average WUE was 1.13 g C kg⁻¹ H₂O, with basin-level values ranging from 0.11 to 1.80 g C kg⁻¹ H₂O. Among them, higher WUE was in basins of moderate elevation and dense vegetation, and lower WUE was in high-elevation or arid basins. This integrative analysis highlights the dominant role of topography and vegetation in shaping WUE patterns and provides a scientific basis for enhancing water resource efficiency and ecological sustainability under changing environmental conditions."

Defining the adiabaticity metric in optical waveguides has been a subject of many studies. An adiabaticity parameter that measures the slowness of evolution can be defined by the analogy between quantum mechanics and guided wave optics. From local coupled-mode theory, an adiabaticity parameter for the evolution of the power of a local mode can be obtained. A coupling coefficient between local modes can then be acquired and used for device optimization. In this work, we examine the different adiabaticity parameters and show how they can be used to engineer the adiabaticity in waveguide devices. It can be shown that for a 3-dB adiabatic coupler waveguide structure, the power obtained from the theoretical expression can accurately describe the mode power, as demonstrated via simulation. Based on the adiabaticity parameter, the adiabaticity of waveguide devices can be engineered using single or multiple control parameters, leading to compact and robust devices."

    "abstract": "Edge computing can overcome many shortcomings of traditional cloud computing and provide high quality computing services. However, it need to face the challenges of node heterogeneity and task diversity, which leads to the performance of edge computing systems relying on proper task scheduling. Existing task scheduling algorithms are usually designed based on mathematical models that are closely related to the internal details of edge computing systems, resulting in poor universality and limited quality of scheduling decisions. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a Clustering and Reinforcement Learning Based Task Scheduling Algorithm for Edge Computing (CRTSE), which aims to shorten the task processing time and improve the energy efficiency of the system. The algorithm uses Adaptive Graph Auto-Encoder (AdaGAE) based clustering algorithm to cluster computing tasks and classify the computing tasks submitted to the edge computing system based on the clustering results. When making scheduling decisions, an independent deep reinforcement learning model is used for each class of computing tasks to obtain targeted scheduling preference information, and the scheduling decision is made based on these preference information. CRTSE possesses good universality due to the feature of not relying on mathematical models that are closely related to the internal details of edge computing systems, and has the ability to adapt well to diverse computing tasks and to learn continuously during the interaction with the system. Simulation experiments based on real data show that CRTSE can shorten the average task processing time of the edge computing system by up to 56.00% and reduce the average energy consumption of the edge computing system by up to 16.10% compared to existing excellent scheduling algorithms."

Then, the Kalman smoothing algorithm refines the state estimates by incorporating future measurements, improving the accuracy of fault state estimation. Based on the error covariance performance index analysis technique, the fault initiation time is determined, and the specific subsystem or component where the fault occurs is located by analyzing anomalies in the state estimates. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively achieves early fault detection, precise localization, and traceability."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging systems play a critical role in the field of remote sensing due to their ability to provide data independently of weather conditions and capture the structural details of surfaces. However, the presence of speckle noise in SAR images blurs class boundaries and reduces classification accuracy. Therefore, filtering methods that suppress noise while preserving edge integrity are of great importance prior to classification. Beyond speckle suppression, these filters enhance spatial consistency by making neighboring pixels more homogeneous, thereby reducing intraclass variance and facilitating the separation of different land cover types. In recent years, edge-preserving filters such as Bilateral Filtering (BF), Domain Transform (DT), and Fast Guided Smoother (FGS) have gained prominence. Nevertheless, their effects on different machine learning algorithms have not yet been sufficiently investigated. In this study, a systematic analysis was carried out on four benchmark datasets (SFBay_C, SFBay_L, Flevo_C, Flevo_L), employing classical machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as baseline classifiers. Performances before and after filtering were comprehensively compared. The experimental results demonstrate that edge-preserving filters, particularly in SVM-based classifications, provide substantial improvements in overall accuracy (OA). Furthermore, comparison of classification maps with ground truth data revealed that filtering enhances both numerical performance and visual quality. In conclusion, integrating edge-preserving filters with machine learning models in SAR imagery not only improves classification accuracy but also supports the reliable mapping of complex environments."

Innovations such as HVDC systems are central to this transformation, ensuring that grids can handle the increasing complexity and demand for sustainable energy. However, challenges remain, especially when it comes to coordinating insulation in hybrid AC/DC systems and maintaining the resilience of the overall infrastructure. This review looks at how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help tackle these challenges, focusing on its role in fault detection, predictive maintenance, and improving system reliability. By comparing traditional methods with AI-driven solutions, we highlight how AI can enhance the scalability, efficiency, and adaptability of power systems. With AI, utilities can predict and prevent faults, optimize grid performance, and seamlessly integrate renewable energy sources into both rural and urban environments. Our goal is to provide insights for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers on how AI can be harnessed to build more sustainable, resilient, and reliable energy systems. The insights shared here aim to help shape the future of power grids, positioning AI as a key player in the transition to cleaner, more efficient energy solutions."

Compared to strong baselines, the system delivers clear gains in retrieval accuracy, answer correctness, and faithfulness, while substantially reducing hallucinations. In particular, LexiTurk14B outperforms its base Qwen3-14B, with correctness increasing from 2.10 to 3.10 in closed-book and 4.23 with RAG.

Conventional, single modal methods that are primarily based on RGB images are often sensitive to complicated textures and varying lighting conditions. To tackle these problems, this paper presents a MM-CNN for static object recognition aggregating RGB and depth information. Built upon a two-branched CNN architecture, the proposed method adopts a dedicated lightweight CNN for depth data and a pre-trained VGG16 model for visual features extraction from RGB images. At the stage after which extracted features are combined in a concatenation manner, a classification full connection layer is connected. The model was tested against benchmark datsets with pairs of RGB and depth images. The experimental results establish that multi-modal data fusion greatly enhances the accuracy of object recognition in comparison with single modal. The proposed method is demonstrated to be a solid and efficient solution for static environment, which can be applied in robotic perception."

Utilizing a comprehensive database comprising critical variables such as short-circuit current (Isc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), maximum power (Pmax), current at maximum power (Imp), voltage at maximum power (Vmp), module temperature (Tm), ambient temperature (T amb), irradiance (G), wind direction (WD), wind speed (WS), and time stamps, our approach facilitated an effective classification of PV module performance. The SVM model successfully grouped the data, enabling us to generate heatmaps that visually represent degradation patterns. This visualization aids in interpreting results and making informed decisions, contrasting sharply with traditional analytical methods that are often more complex and less intuitive. Our findings suggest that this machine learning approach is not only effective for individual PV modules but also scalable for assessing the performance of multiple PV installations.

Subsequently, the system is transformed into a FAS representation, and a robust control law is derived using minmax optimization theory. Finally, simulation studies confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. Under fault conditions, the algorithm achieves markedly better tracking accuracy than traditional min–max robust control methods."

    "abstract": "The population of cities increases constantly all around the world, so transport systems of cities experience many problems with congestion and increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Hence, this research analyses the application of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks and intelligent traffic management systems (ITMS) for low-emission urban mobility solutions. In this endeavor, the research seeks to evaluate the impact of these technologies in enhancing flow of traffic, emissions efficiency and sustainable transport systems. Self-generated survey of primary data was collected from five large cities of China where IoT based traffic management and ITMS solutions were deployed. Descriptive analysis, correlation, regression, ANOVA, chi square tests and time series analysis was used to quantify the effect of these systems. This research findings show that traffic management systems, which are based on the IoT technology cause up to 60% reduction in traffic congestion and comparable decrease in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. As evident by results where City D, benefiting from frequent usage of public transportation and large coverage of ITMS, successfully lowered the carbon emission and congestion rate in comparison to other cities. Substantial cohesion was noted between the two transport objectives mainly; traffic flow optimization and emissions reduction where ITMS had a pivotal role to play in the emissions reduction through optimizing the traffic signals, thus leading to minimization of congestion. Also, with the increased usage of IoT in public transports there was recorded higher passenger traffic leading to more relief to roads from private cars and fumes. However, the study also reveals that there are perceived areas of difficulty namely investments in infrastructures, security of data and finally the awareness across the population about IoT and ITMS solutions. The research opens up possibilities that are important for policy makers as well as urban planners to understand how they can make travel low carbon and foster more sustainable cities. Therefore, it is necessary for theoreticians and practitioners to conduct further studies on how to extend IoT connectedness, involve citizens and overcome the security issues."

Operating at 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, the proposed array achieves impedance bandwidths exceeding 14% at each band, with S11 below –10 dB and realized gains of 2.01 dBi, 3.94 dBi, and 5.32 dBi, respectively. Beam steering is accomplished across five discrete angles (±45°, ±15°, 0°) using PIN-diode-controlled phase shifters, although robust tri-band matching is maintained primarily in the +45° configuration. At 6 GHz, the effective steering range is reduced due to feed network dispersion and mutual coupling effects. Despite these limitations, the antenna maintains efficiencies of 44–48% and sidelobe suppression above 12 dB on a cost-effective FR-4 substrate, offering a compact and scalable solution for next-generation Wi-Fi 7 access points and IoT devices."

In this work, we introduce a modular and adaptive framework for providing secure identity management, real-time trust assessment, and policy-based access control using various blockchain, and AI-based mechanisms. The architecture is developed using federated identity, public key infrastructure, and a dynamic trust tensor model to provide quantitative relationship representations of vehicles, users, and infrastructure interactions. We employ edge-cloud storage, Zero Trust architectures, and secure communications standards (DSRC, 5G, MQTT) that provide the lowest latency possible, the best privacy, and resistance to spoofing and Sybil attacks. The implementation based on simulators from the SUMO and Veins platform, the Hyperledger network, and smart contract framework, shows better performance results across aggregate performance metrics (e.g., 96.8% trust assessment accuracy; 12ms avg response time; 0.3% breach rate). Overall, the designs we developed appear to provide vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services better than models that already establish their models successfully such as SCBTM, LSCP and PT-RBAC in terms of reliability, scalability and real-world deployability.

    "abstract": "Key quality prediction is crucial in the process industry for effective process control and monitoring. Recently, Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable success due to their powerful multi-head attention mechanism for sequence modeling. However, the conventional approach of handling multiple attention heads fails to assess their importance in feature extraction, leading to redundancy from non-essential information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel Quality Relevance-Aware Multi-Head Attention for Transformer (QR-Former). First, the multi-head attention mechanism extracts features from the input sequence. Then, for each attention head, its outputs across all samples form multivariate feature time sequences. To establish relationships with the quality sequence, we compute the similarity between each univariate feature time sequence within a head and the corresponding quality label sequence. This enables us to quantify the importance of each head based on the overall similarity of its output feature dimensions. The extracted features from different heads are then weighted and concatenated for further modeling within the Transformer structure. QR-Former is applied to quality prediction for two datasets from an industrial hydrocracking process. Its effectiveness is validated through comparisons with mainstream Transformer-based methods."

This study explores a unique approach to Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) within enterprise graphs by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Shallow Graph Node Embeddings. By incorporating both local node features and global graph structure, our model effectively differentiates between entities with the same name based on their surrounding context within the graph. We introduce a new methodology for embedding entities that enhances the recognition of subtle differences, improving the overall precision of the disambiguation process. Through comparative analysis with traditional graph-based models like Node2Vec and Strongly Connected Component Algorithms (SCCA), we demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in resolving entity conflicts, thus enabling more accurate investment insights and better risk management in financial networks."

    "abstract": "The frequent False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) caused by the increase in the number of charging stations and the high uncertainty of electric vehicle charging have made it increasingly difficult to accurately predict the load of charging stations. To this end, a short-term load forecasting architecture method based on Fuzzy Logic Control Transformer (FLCT) is proposed. Firstly, a fuzzy confidence function based on sliding variance, correlation between load and price/usage rate is constructed through fuzzy logic design to generate a credibility score for each time step to reduce the impact of attacks. Then, fuzzy weighting is introduced into the attention mechanism of Transformer to focus on high-confidence data and strengthen the learning of normal load data. Finally, through experimental analysis of contaminated data under different attack levels, the results show that the proposed method has good prediction performance and strong robustness, and can effectively predict the load of charging stations under attack, ensuring the smooth operation of the power system."

    "abstract": "Medical imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing diseases. Its textual interpretation is vital for analysis and treatment planning. Automating report generation eases radiologists’ workload and boosts clinical automation. This field has gained attention with the development of AI in healthcare. Prior studies often used pre-trained CNNs like VGG and ResNet for feature extraction. However, despite their effectiveness, their local receptive fields limit the ability to capture global context. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel approach, ViT-R2GenCMN, which employs the Vision Transformer (ViT) to replace the traditional CNN-based visual extractor. ViT processes images by segmenting them into patch sequences and utilizes a self-attention mechanism to directly model global dependencies. In this work, we integrate ViT into the Cross-modal Memory Networks (CMN) framework to improve the alignment between visual and textual information, thereby enhancing the quality of generated radiology reports. This paper examines the applicability of ViT in the task of radiology report generation and evaluates its specific impact on cross-modal interaction performance. The experimental results on the widely recognized IU X-Ray benchmark dataset are satisfactory. ViT-R2GenCMN achieved scores of 0.163 and 0.576 on the BLEU-4 and CIDEr evaluation metrics, respectively. These results demonstrate a certain improvement compared to previous models."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has emerged as a critical tool in remote sensing because it can be used to take images under any weather conditions and during day or night. Though SAR imagery has its benefits, it tends to have low visual interpretability due to its grayscale nature, noise and lack of fine detail, which can cause it to be viewed as less useful for applications that need human interpretation. In order to solve these difficulties, DiffuseNet is proposed, a new two-stage deep learning model for coloring and enhancing SAR images to make it more visually interpretable. For the first stage, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) is employed for colorization, with grayscale SAR images being converted to their colored versions through discovering the correspondence between the input intensity patterns and valid color distributions. This provides semantic richness and contextual depth to the images. In the second phase, a self-evolving diffusion model is used to further enhance the images by removing noise, sharpening and enhancing texture consistency, thus yielding clearer and more realistic results. The synergy of the generative ability of cGAN and the denoising ability of diffusion models allows DiffuseNet to produce high-quality, color-augmented SAR images. Experimentation indicates that improved performance is obtained by our approach in both visual and numerical comparisons, over existing methods. By offering improved clarity and colorization, DiffuseNet is introduced as a powerful tool for a wide range of remote sensing applications such as environmental monitoring, land cover classification, disaster assessment and surveillance."

We investigate standardized candidates from NIST's PQC Project (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium) and their resistance to hybrid attacks. In addition, we also investigate the hardware acceleration (e.g., FPGA, ASIC) approach to alleviate the latency bottleneck. Transition strategies, such as hybrid cryptography (the coupling of classical and PQC algorithms) and zero-trust frameworks to maintain backward compatibility, are a key focus here. We further discuss side-channel vulnerabilities specific to PQC implementations and suggest mitigation strategies. These findings emphasize the need for a continued focus in areas such as scalability, standardization and quantum secure key distribution and the importance of collaboration between academia, industry and policymakers.\" By tackling these issues, PQC can secure next-gen networks from quantum dangers while aging to be efficient and trustworthy."

However, currently, there is no literature reporting the application of SCX to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). This paper adapts and implements several variants of the SCX operator within a genetic algorithm framework tailored for VRPTW, systematically comparing their performance in benchmark instances. Furthermore, several other commonly used crossover operators are compared.

    "abstract": "In cybersecurity, the identification of cryptographic algorithms is very important to perform digital forensics, intrusion detection and reverse engineering. This paper brings forward a framework to identify the type of cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt the given text. The framework is a combination of machine learning and blockchain technologies. Individual machine learning models are trained for a particular cryptographic algorithm like AES, DES, RSA, SHA256 and Blowfish. ML algorithms like CNN, SVM, Hybrid KNN+RF, XGBoost are used to train the models. Each machine learning model is then placed in individual blockchain nodes. When a user inputs a ciphertext, it is analysed by all the blockchain nodes. Every node runs its model and a prediction output is generated. The model with the highest confidence score is then used for the final classification. The system also has a dynamic trust value mechanism where the node’s credibility is updated dynamically based upon the accuracy. A smart contract is put in place to ensure secure processing and logging. The output is visualized and displayed in an interactive user interface. The accuracy of all the models is pretty high proving the worth of this system. This is a scalable and decentralized method for identifying cryptographic algorithms, which can be used both in research and security operations."

This work proposes an optomechanical fiber-optic acoustic sensor employing an aluminum spiral-beams–supported diaphragm with a tunable resonant frequency, integrated into a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. Finite-element-guided design and experiments demonstrate a calibrated sensitivity of 6.127 V/Pa, a minimum detectable pressure of 51.23 μPa / √<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Hz</i> at 112 Hz, and a frequency response spanning 50 Hz to 20 kHz. To enable spatiotemporal tracking, we build a four-sensor array and develop a real-time adaptive strong-tracking unscented Kalman filter (AST-UKF) pipeline that enhances TDOA-based localization under low-SNR, reverberant conditions, reconstructing moving-source trajectories with 0.88 cm RMSE. The combination of low-frequency-optimized sensing and array-level inference yields a compact, passive, and electro-magnetic interference immune platform for weak-signal detection and trajectory tracking, providing practical support for online monitoring and decision-making in industrial environments."

    "abstract": "Multi-core fiber (MCF), with a multichannel structure, can serve very effectively as an alternative sensing platform for measuring multiple physical parameters using a single fiber. Femtosecond laser 3D printing technology significantly improves the integration of the devices, due to high processing precision and flexibility it offers. A triple-parameter sensor based on Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavities on a multicore fiber tip was demonstrated. Three different FP cavities were fabricated by femtosecond laser 3D printing on the end faces of the three fiber cores. Temperature, humidity, and pressure were measured using a fluid-infiltrated closed microcavity, an open air-cavity, and a closed hollow cavity, respectively. The sensitivities of these devices were shown to be -182.4 pm/°C, 109 pm/% RH, and 11.24 pm/kPa respectively. This tiny fiber-tip sensor created in this way has the advantages of compact structure, small volume, ease of packaging and low cost. The sensor discussed thus enables monitoring of temperature, humidity, and pressure, and as a device has the potential to be applied in chemical manufacturing and storage, to reduce the risk of leakage and explosion of hazardous chemicals through better in situ monitoring."

Our network employs a dual-branch architecture, combining the high-resolution representations of points with the computational efficiency of sparse voxels. Our fastest variant outperforms all nondiffusion generative approaches on unconditional shape generation, the most popular benchmark for evaluating point cloud generative models, while our largest model achieves state-of-the-art results among diffusion methods, with a runtime approximately 70% of the previously state-of-the-art point-voxel diffusion (PVD), measured on the same hardware setting. Beyond unconditional generation, we perform extensive evaluations, including conditional generation on all categories of ShapeNet, demonstrating the scalability of our model to larger datasets, and implicit generation, which allows our network to produce high-quality point clouds on fewer timesteps, further decreasing the generation time. Finally, we evaluate the architecture’s performance in point cloud completion and super-resolution. Our model excels in all tasks, establishing it as a state-of-the-art diffusion U-Net for point cloud generative modeling.

However, the high maneuverability of the spiral trajectory poses significant challenges, such as model mismatch, image defocusing, and positioning algorithm failures. To address these challenges, a geometric vector model of HSV SAR with a spiral trajectory is established, and the corresponding signal and trajectory characteristics are analyzed. Subsequently, the 3-D coordinate positioning approach based on HSV SAR with spiral trajectory is proposed. The proposed method achieves target positioning via two-dimensional (2-D) multi-view imaging, SAR target matching, and 3-D coordinate calculation. This method is relatively novel and provides superior imaging and positioning performance. Simulation, real data, and semi-real data experiments are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This article presents two active circulator monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) that contain integrated tunable cancellers with one and two canceller sections. The chips were fabricated in gallium nitride (GaN) and operate between 2.5 and 3.2 GHz. In addition to enabling an antenna to be shared between transmit and receive, they uniquely provide transmit and receive gains greater than 10 up to 20 dBm of transmit power output and roughly a 7-dB noise figure, as well as tunable transmit-to-receive isolation of more than 50 dB. The active circulator is also evaluated with a radar chirp waveform and, when combined with a subsequent digital cancellation filter, suppresses the SI by a total of 70 dB, within 1 dB of the receiver noise floor."

Particularly, these decisions must jointly account for workflow characteristics, the resources available at each edge server, as well as local constraints (e.g., communication distance, task latency, and bandwidth conditions), which again increases the difficulty of optimizing the problem. However, no existing study addresses such joint optimization problems for these tightly coupled decisions. To fill this gap, a minimum-delay workflow partitioning algorithm is first designed to determine the optimal task offloading solution under various resource conditions. Based on this algorithm, two locality-based social welfare maximization models (basic and dynamic) are constructed. Specifically, for basic model, a multi-stage task matching game with the second lowest cost strategy is developed to determine the resource selection and pricing. For the dynamic model with uncertain requests, an online learning algorithm is introduced to track the dynamic valuations of mobile devices and to ensure that the resulting task allocation solution achieves an upper-bounded regret. Strict theoretical analysis demonstrates that our mechanism guarantees individual rationality, Nash Equilibrium, and stable approximation ratio. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our mechanism, and show that the proposed mechanisms obtain at most 18% higher social welfare than existing studies."

To address data heterogeneity across edge devices, federated multi-view learning (FedMVL) has been proposed to improve global model performance by capturing consistency and complementarity among diverse data views. However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions and neglect data uncertainty in mobile edge devices environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose Federated Reliable Multi-view Classification (FedRMVL), a vertical FedMVL framework incorporates Subjective Logic for lightweight uncertainty quantification at local edge devices and applies the Dempster-Shafer combination rule for adaptive and reliable multi-view opinion fusion at the server. Additionally, a partial parameter-sharing strategy is introduced to address feature dimension heterogeneity during federated optimization. The effectiveness and robustness of FedRMVL are validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) is a common sleep disorder that impacts quality of life and often goes undiagnosed. The gold-standard for SAHS detection, polysomnography (PSG), is expensive and inconvenient for long-term monitoring. As a result, research has increasingly shifted toward alternative approaches, such as radar sensors. Feature extraction is crucial for SAHS detection using radar-based respiratory signals. It relies not only on the expertise of specialists and their prior knowledge of respiratory patterns, but also on the methodologies used to extract respiration from the radar. This study presents an automated feature extraction method that utilizes radar respiratory signals processed through variational mode decomposition (VMD) to better preserve the morphological structure of breathing patterns, followed by a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-Transformer for classifying SAHS events from normal segments. Then, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is applied to discriminate SAHS subjects from healthy ones. Our study involved 20 PSG recordings and IR-UWB radar data across all sleeping positions. The proposed method achieved per-segment classification accuracy of 93.85% (88.28%), sensitivity of 87.86% (75.52%), specificity of 93.97% (95.74%), F1-score of 90.6% (82.62%), and Cohen’s kappa of 0.763 (0.724) using leave-one-out cross-validation for two (thee)-class classifications. AHI estimation analysis showed a strong correlation between the estimated and reference AHI, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.996. In addition, SAHS diagnosis achieved an average accuracy of 98.33% and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.96 for AHI thresholds of ≥5, 15, and 30 events/h."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality mapping. We establish temporally consistent tri-view correspondences to enable three core contributions. First, Hybrid Geometric Constraints combine geometric cues (trifocal and 3D alignment) with photometric supervision, ensuring stable pose estimation when illumination shifts cause rendering inconsistencies. Second, TUGI estimates uncertainty from multi-view 3D geometric consistency-capturing cross-view stability rather than pairwise 2D matching confidence-to guide principled Gaussian initialization. Third, DART adaptively attenuates photometric trust when rendering degrades, allowing geometric priors to govern optimization. Experiments on multiple public outdoor datasets show that TVG-SLAM outperforms prior RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our method reduces the average ATE by 69.0% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality."

    "abstract": "Coaxial bi-copter autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) have garnered attention due to their potential for improved rotor system efficiency and compact form factor. However, balancing efficiency, maneuverability, and compactness in coaxial bi-copter systems remains a key design challenge, limiting their practical deployment. This letter introduces COMET, a coaxial bi-copter AAV platform featuring a dual swashplate mechanism. The coaxial bi-copter system's efficiency and compactness are optimized through bench tests, and the whole prototype's efficiency and robustness under varying payload conditions are verified through flight endurance experiments. The maneuverability performance of the system is evaluated in comprehensive trajectory tracking tests. The results indicate that the dual swashplate configuration enhances tracking performance and improves flight efficiency compared to the single swashplate alternative. Successful autonomous flight trials across various scenarios verify COMET's potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "The fully decoupled configuration integrating high-aspect-ratio flexible beams and proof masses is a widely adopted design in Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) vibratory gyroscopes. However, such structures are extremely sensitive to microfabrication errors, particularly beam width deviations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a high-order nonlinear dynamic modeling method and a robust optimization strategy for fully decoupled MEMS gyroscopes, explicitly accounting for microfabrication errors. Nonlinear stiffness expressions are derived for double-folded beams, V-shaped coupling beams, and composite beams, and a high-order dynamic model is established incorporating both geometric and electrostatic nonlinearities. Theoretical natural frequencies agree well with finite element simulations, with deviations below 3.3%. Assuming all beam width deviations are normally distributed, the direct probability integration method (DPIM) is used to quantify gyroscope performance uncertainties in mechanical sensitivity and quadrature output. Robust optimization is conducted using beam structural parameters and drive voltage as design variables, aiming to improve sensitivity while minimizing deviations in sensitivity and quadrature output. The optimized gyroscope structure demonstrates strong robustness against beam width deviations, achieving a 3.75 times improvement in sensitivity and a 31% reduction in quadrature output. The 1σ standard deviation of sensitivity and quadrature output is significantly reduced by 78.1% and 40.2%, respectively, effectively suppressing the impact of fabrication errors on device performance."

    "abstract": "Road inspection is crucial for maintaining road serviceability and ensuring traffic safety, as road defects gradually develop and compromise functionality. Traditional inspection methods, which rely on manual evaluations, are labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming. While data-driven approaches are gaining traction, the scarcity and spatial sparsity of real-world road defects present significant challenges in acquiring high-quality datasets. Existing simulators designed to generate detailed synthetic driving scenes, however, lack models for road defects. Moreover, advanced driving tasks that involve interactions with road surfaces, such as planning and control in defective areas, remain underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal sensor platform integrated with an urban digital twin (UDT) system for intelligent road inspection. First, hierarchical road models are constructed from real-world driving data collected using vehicle-mounted sensors, resulting in highly detailed representations of road defect structures and surface elevations. Next, digital road twins are generated to create simulation environments for comprehensive analysis and evaluation of algorithm performance. These scenarios are then imported into a simulator to facilitate both data acquisition and physical simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that driving tasks, including perception and decision-making, benefit significantly from the high-fidelity road defect scenes generated by our system."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a fixed-time active fault-tolerant tracking issue for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Firstly, a nonsingular fixed-time fuzzy tracking control algorithm is proposed, enabling robust tracking performance. Building upon this algorithm, an adaptive controller is designed for the UAV system subject to stochastic disturbances, which are modeled as a standard Wiener processes. Unlike traditional control strategies, the proposed controller can effectively avoid the singularity of the control input. In addition, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is employed to approximate unknown nonlinearities. Meanwhile, the controller can guarantee the boundness of all system states in probability within afixed-time, independent of initial conditions. Futhermore, To address sensor faults, a robust three-step unscented Kalman filter (RTS-UKF) is utilized for fault detection and estimation. The estimated fault signals are structurally embedded into the control law, forming a closed-loop fault compensation mechanism. Finally, simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Existing models often fail to integrate both temporal patterns and structural features, limiting their predictive power. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning framework called TDACNN, which combines Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to enhance prediction accuracy. The model utilizes rolling window inputs from stock price sequences, daily sentiment scores derived from financial news, and macroeconomic indicators including DSEX and DS30 indices from the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). TDA features capture statistical trends across sliding windows, while CNN layers extract short-term local patterns. Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning is employed to optimize model configuration. The model is evaluated using data from five DSE-listed companies and compared with traditional and deep learning baselines such as BiLSTM, BiGRU, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The experimental results show that TDACNN achieves better performance with lower MAE and MSE values and a higher R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score.

The proposed scheme employs a pair of finite impulse response (FIR) filters to encrypt and decrypt the sensor output, integrated with unknown-input observers (UIO) for attack detection. Theoretical analysis demonstrates how the multiplicative watermarking enhances the observer’s ability to detect attacks by amplifying residual signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on a four-area DC microgrid system."

    "abstract": "In this era of growing dependence on renewable energy sources (RESs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines, ensuring power grid stability has become a critical challenge. RESs are beneficial as a clean and affordable energy option, but they are uncertain in terms of constant power. Solar panels may be less effective at dusk, wind turbines may be slow on one day with no wind, but the electricity demand always persists. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) come here in as silent but efficient balance keepers between generation and load. BESS stores extra energy when supply is high, especially when renewables are available, and releases it when demand goes up, which helps reduce energy prices and makes renewable integration more stable. This paper presents a logical-numerical model of BESS developed using MATLAB/Simulink, which provides a simple yet effective framework for BESS modeling charge-discharge activities. This model is built of modular parts, including a charge-discharge controller, power conversion system, and battery unit, all of which are designed for uncomplicated analysis and adjustment. Using simulated scenarios such as peak shaving, load shifting, and load leveling, this model proves that it can be used to smooth energy bills and improve productivity. By establishing a low-barrier system for feasibility analysis, this approach helps planners and academics to integrate clean energy sources and handle modern grid demands more efficiently."

The GA-FMD algorithm is then employed to adaptively decompose the signal into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), with fault-related modes identified utilizing correlation kurtosis criteria. Subsequently, wavelet soft-threshold denoising is implemented to mitigate high-frequency noise interference. Finally, optimal modal components are selected through Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, and characteristic features are systematically extracted and comprehensively analyzed. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology efficaciously decomposes periodic impact components, precisely identifies fault frequencies, and substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby establishing a superior and more robust framework for brake disc dynamic balance detection."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an interference suppression scheme for advanced antenna systems (AAS), targeting unknown interference without relying on prior knowledge of its characteristics. The approach is applied to uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) with half-wavelength dipole elements and is designed to optimize radiation patterns through amplitude control. A fitness function is formulated based on total output power minimization, incorporating a static penalty technique to enforce constraints and steer nulls in interference directions while preserving the main-lobe gain. To solve the binary optimization problem, two metaheuristic algorithms, Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) and Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO), are employed, with BGWO selected as the primary optimizer for its balance between exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulations across three scenarios: convergence analysis, adaptive null-steering, and evaluation of amplitude quantization resolution. Results show that the method achieves high interference suppression capability, efficient beam shaping, and reduced computational cost, making it suitable for next-generation wireless systems such as 5G and 6G operating in dynamic and interference-prone environments."

Six months of 380 V/16 A/11 kW AC charger data show that WOA-Bi-LSTM outperforms vanilla Bi-LSTM in RMSE and MAPE, yields smoother voltage, current and power curves with smaller residuals, and raises diagnostic accuracy from 87.8 % to 95.6 %, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness."

    "abstract": "The problem of oversegmentation in brain tumor segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) poses significant challenges, particularly when finding complex anatomical structures where conventional segmentation models often fail to preserve topological integrity. This study integrates persistent homology into the training of a Multi-Modal Modified Residual U-net (MMResUnet) to introduce a topology-aware loss framework, focusing on enhancing the topological correctness of segmentation outputs. By integrating topological loss functions, the proposed method penalizes discrepancies in topological features between ground truth and predicted segmentations, which in turn lessens oversegmentation errors. The framework is evaluated on the BraTS2021 benchmark brain tumor dataset, demonstrating improved performance in maintaining structural continuity and reducing topological inaccuracies compared to traditional loss functions like Categorical Cross Entropy or Dice Loss. The results of this model highlight the ability of topological considerations in refining models for complex medical image segmentation tasks like brain tumor segmentation. The framework achieves 99.62% Accuracy, 96.18% Precision, 97.73% Recall, 98.20% Specificity, 85.72% Intersection over Union (IoU), 92.03% Dice Score for Edema (ED), 1.3 Betti Number Error (BNE) and 0.039 Wasserstein Distance."

First, the dangers of thermal runaway and propagation in lithium-ion batteries are explained, and the limitations of existing fixed threshold warnings are highlighted, as well as the characteristics and limitations of dynamic threshold models and the two types of safety strategy. The experiment uses 18650 cylindrical lithium iron phosphate batteries, and a 5x5 diamond-shaped thermal management system is built, filled with a composite phase change material (paraffin + 10% expanding graphite) and, through the experimental platform, set the 33rd battery as the hot spot to trigger the hot spot, simulating the hot spot spreading under different cooling conditions and establishing the relevant simulation model. After grid independence, battery modelling, phase change cooling and hot spot temperature threshold verification, the model was found to be highly reliable. The study found that the composite phase change material cooling could significantly delay the occurrence and spread of the hot spot, with the 33rd battery taking 2.7 s and the time for all batteries to reach thermal runaway increased by almost twofold. This study has verified the reliability of the model, clarified the impact of different cooling methods, and provided a reference for optimising battery thermal management systems."

    "abstract": "The widespread dissemination of fake news through digital media platforms presents a critical threat to public trust, democratic institutions, and social stability. While machine learning has shown great promise in automating fake news detection, a significant research gap remains in understanding how hyperparameter tuning affects the performance of these models. Many existing studies overlook this aspect, treating model configurations as fixed and underexploring their optimization potential. This study aims to fill that gap by systematically evaluating the impact of hyperparameter optimization on three widely used machine learning classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Naïve Bayes, in the context of fake news classification. Using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, textual features were extracted using TF-IDF vectorization, and each model was trained under optimized settings: k=5 for KNN, C=1.0 with a linear kernel for SVM, and alpha=1.0 for Naïve Bayes. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, supported by statistical t-tests to validate significance. The results reveal that SVM outperforms KNN and Naïve Bayes across all metrics, achieving the highest accuracy (74.1%), recall (87.1%), and F1-score (80.4%), with statistically significant differences (p < 0.001). While Naïve Bayes achieved perfect recall (100%), it suffered from poor precision (61.6%), making it unsuitable for precision-sensitive applications. The findings highlight that hyperparameter tuning significantly influences model effectiveness and overlooking it may lead to misleading conclusions or suboptimal system performance. This paper contributes a replicable experimental framework and provides evidence-based guidance for selecting and configuring machine learning models in fake news detection. By addressing an underexplored but essential aspect of model development, this work strengthens the foundation for building more accurate, scalable, and robust AI-driven misinformation detection systems."

Owing to their high energy density, rapid response capability, and relatively low production costs, they have long been preferred for various applications. Even today, they continue to serve as the primary power units for automobiles, trucks, ships, and certain types of generators. However, the growing concerns over fuel consumption, increasing emission levels, and global environmental regulations have made it necessary to reconsider the balance between performance, efficiency, and emissions in these engines. Consequently, optimization has become an indispensable engineering approach in modern engine development processes. Studies in the literature indicate that multi-objective optimization techniques provide effective solutions for enhancing engine performance parameters. In spark-ignition engines, ignition timing and air–fuel ratio is the main focus of optimization studies, while in diesel engines, injection pressure and injection strategies play a crucial role. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution methods, and NSGA-II/NSGA-III enable engineers to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions that balance fuel consumption and emissions, offering diverse alternatives suitable for different design conditions. In conclusion, optimization-oriented research on gasoline and diesel engines not only enhances fuel economy and performance but also establishes a significant scientific foundation for supporting environmental sustainability."

The key merits of our approach are twofold: First, the proposed BRB-WT method can effectively capture characteristics, such as high-frequency components and rapid signal changes, from time-domain signals of UAVs. Second, the formulated gradient descent optimization algorithm exhibits greater interpretability than existing BRB models that utilize the projection covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (P-CMA-ES). Collectively, these improvements result in a substantial boost to the overall efficacy of the BRB-WT diagnostic approach.

In addition to this, this blockchain-based system also ensures that no one control is there for the voting process by any particular entity; hence, it guarantees impartiality. Because of ZKPs, it is ensured that voter verification can take place without exposing sensitive personal data in nature. Unlike the traditional e-voting-on-a-blockchain models, ours includes a dynamic key rotation mechanism for further anonymity of votes, with a multi-layer encryption to protect voter credentials even against potential quantum computing threats. Further, this blocking-based system makes sure that not a single entity is controlling the entire process of voting, thus guaranteeing impartiality. Voter verification takes place through the means of ZKP without any sensitive personal information being revealed. As a result, end-to-end encryption keeps intact the integrity of a vote from the moment it is cast until it is finally counted, further building confidence in the election process. It turns out to be a safe and scalable solution for future worldwide adoption of evoting."

    "abstract": "In order to accurately anticipate the beginning of disease utilising consecutive Electronic Health Records (EHRs), this study suggests a unique deep learning architecture based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). The capacity of TCNs to simulate long-range temporal dependencies is greater than that of classic recurrent models like RNNs and LSTMs, allowing for more precise and timely predictions. The framework is extremely resistant to the anomalies commonly present in real-world EHR datasets because it integrates attention mechanisms, adaptive sampling strategies, and robust handling of missing data. This method outperforms traditional deep learning models, such as Transformers, in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, according to experimental assessment on extensive health data including both acute and chronic diseases. Additionally, its compact and lightweight form allows for deployment in clinical settings with limited resources, enabling quick, in-the-moment analysis and decision-making. Together, these developments show how TCN-based architectures have the ability to revolutionise predictive medicine by facilitating early interventions, enhancing treatment planning tailored to individual patients, and bolstering proactive public health initiatives."

    "abstract": "Traditional authentication protocols, which rely on centralized identity providers, face significant challenges with latency and bandwidth consumption as modern information systems scale to a large number of users and real-time processing. Edge authentication offers a promising solution by shifting user verification to local devices, thereby reducing dependency on a central server. However, this approach requires a secure and efficient method for distributing authentication data to edge devices and ensuring a efficient verification process. This paper proposes a novel edge authentication protocol designed for efficiency and security, particularly for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The protocol addresses the key challenges by leveraging a cryptographic accumulator. This data structure provides a compact and verifiable representation of the authentication database that can be securely distributed to edge devices. The core advantage is its ability to perform verification with an O(1) time complexity, which not only accelerates the process but also enables the system to operate effectively in low-bandwidth environments with a high number of users. The operational mechanism of this theoretical protocol is detailed, with future work planned for implementation and practical performance testing."

    "abstract": "A small number of photovoltaic modules degrade far more rapidly than average, creating a “long tail” in degradation rate distribution that poses a critical challenge to the reliability and financial viability of solar projects. This study investigates the factors contributing to this phenomenon by analyzing a large global dataset from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Our analysis reveals that the long tail is an intrinsic and composite feature of module degradation, not merely a statistical consequence of combining different climates. We identify at least three distinct pathways that could contribute to its formation. The first is accelerated degradation driven by strong statistical associations between different degradation modes, where the interplay of mechanisms appears to be a primary contributor of the most severely degraded modules. The second is rapid early-life failure (infant mortality), which populates the tail with modules likely containing initial manufacturing or material defects. The third is failure of individual latent defects, such as solder fatigue or cell cracks, which can cause sudden severe performance loss at random points in a module's life. Based on our results, we suggest that efforts should be made to understand and mitigate the interaction between associated degradation modes. For instance, the careful selection of key components, such as backsheet, is crucial as it could initiate multiple pathways of degradation."

    "abstract": "The continued surge in data traffic is driving the need for high-capacity solutions in future optical access networks. Coherent passive optical networks are emerging as a promising candidate to meet this demand. However, one specific challenge is integrating low-cost lasers while overcoming severe wavelength drift. Here, we propose a joint adaptive polarization and frequency tracking equalizer designed for wavelength drift tracking, polarization demultiplexing, and linear impairment compensation. This equalizer is embedded within a low complexity digital signal processing and paired with an optimized preamble structure. The preamble is carefully designed to perform multiple functions using a shared training sequence: frame synchronization, frequency offset estimation, and state-of polarization tracking, thereby reducing overhead. We validate our approach through proof-of-concept experiments, transmitting a 200 Gb/s dual-polarization 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulated signal using three tested lasers. The proposed scheme achieves a 3 dB improvement in receiver sensitivity, along with fast convergence, strong tolerance to laser wavelength drift, and low implementation complexity. These results demonstrate the scheme's suitability for next-generation coherent passive optical network systems."

However, previous field trials of this approach have mainly focused on localizing strong events under controlled or relatively quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the capability of forward-transmission vibration sensing to detect weak signals in noisy environments. We demonstrate a highsensitivity vibration sensing system operating over an 80-km deployed live urban fiber loop without optical amplifiers. The system is enhanced by adaptive time-frequency masking and inband laser phase noise suppression techniques to improve sensitivity and noise robustness. It has successfully identified and localized weak real-world vibration events with peak-to-peak amplitude lower than 20 rad, such as construction activity near a manhole and even footsteps on handhole lids. Field trial results confirm its robust performance under dynamic environments, including road traffic-induced ground vibrations and aerial cable disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of weak vibration event detection using forward transmission in urban fiber networks. It remarks a significant step towards practical distributed vibration sensing in smart city applications."

Building on an oligopoly model that integrates automation and digital innovation choices, we show analytically that market power and dynamic capabilities act as strategic complements, jointly amplifying the returns on digital investments. Using a global sample of 545 incumbent firms across seven industries, we find strong empirical support for this prediction: transformational capabilities and asymmetric market positions significantly increase the return on digital technologies, especially for early adopters and firms with an innovation-biased strategy. The study demonstrates research rigour by combining a micro-founded structural model with extensive econometric validation, including instrumental-variable estimation, multiple robustness checks, and industry- and geography-adjusted controls. Our results offer new insight into why digital returns are highly skewed across firms and explain why many incumbents experience limited performance gains despite large investments in digital technologies."

Indeed, the iron loss distribution calculation relies only on the calculation on only a few elements of mesh and not on all elements like in the case of the standard method. The proposed methods are tested on a nonlinear magnetic example based on an axial flux machine showing a good agreement between the iron losses distribution obtained by the standard and the proposed methods."

Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data, combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses, revealed a multiphase alloy composed of a DyPtIn, DyPt₂In, and DyPt intermetallic phases. The alloy exhibit three magnetic transitions: two successive ferromagnetic transitions at 32.5 K and 23.0 K, and a field-dependent antiferromagnetic-like transition at 7.5 K, which together sustain an nearly constant adiabatic temperature change of ~2.1 K across a broad temperature range (2.5–57 K) and a maximum magnetic entropy change of ~6.3 J/kg·K for a field variation of 50 kOe. The results demonstrate the potential of Dy–Pt–In multiphase systems to extend the working temperature span and enhance the performance of cryogenic magnetic refrigeration applications."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves the topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined on flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor—a multi-dimensional array of numbers—to each point in space. Tensor fields, such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific data compressors SZ3 and SPERR."

This study presents an integrated framework, Lean Healthcare 4.0, that combines Lean Healthcare (LH), discrete-event simulation, and deep learning (DL) to address inefficiencies and errors in clinical laboratories. LH was applied to identify non-value-adding activities and streamline patient and sample flows, while simulation modeled operational dynamics and validated potential improvements. Two DL-based models (v11 and v12) were developed to support real-time visual inspection of blood sample tubes. In parallel, a prompt DL system automated phlebotomist-patient signaling. Results indicate a 25% reduction in patient waiting time at registration and a 20% decrease prior to sampling, alongside improved turnaround time and turnover time. The YOLO models achieved up to 94.0% precision, 92.7% recall, and 97.2% mAP, performing comparably to phlebotomists, validating their suitability in assisting phlebotomists through real-time, smarter inspection. This work demonstrates the synergistic role of Lean Healthcare, simulation, and deep learning to improve patient flow and the quality of care of laboratory operations. The findings offer a scalable, data-driven framework for deploying Industry 4.0 principles within resource-constrained healthcare environments."

Traditional research has primarily focused on enhancing charging efficiency, while the critical issue of location privacy security arising from wireless charging has received scant attention. Additionally, sensors are vulnerable to detection and harm by malicious attackers, posing a significant threat to network integrity. In this paper, we propose two attack schemes, termed Least Squares Method (LSM) attack model and Centroid Method (CM) attack model for compromising sensor location privacy by exploiting charging power information and mobile charger behaviors. To counter such threats, we develop a scheme aimed at maximizing the node location privacy protection capabilities of the network. We propose a theoretical analysis to exploit the features of the proposed scheme. Finally, extensive test-bed experiments and simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. The results demonstrate that our algorithms can protect at least 78% of the nodes without significantly compromising their survival rate."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates distributed leaderless attitude consensus for multi-spacecraft systems with full-state constraints under switching directed graphs. The coexistence of attitude and angular velocity constraints poses significant challenges for the control design of multi-spacecraft systems. To tackle this issue, a transformation method is first introduced to convert the constrained attitude dynamics into an unconstrained form. A linear reference model is designed to guide consensus in the transformed space under switching directed graphs. Then, a virtual controller is designed via a backstepping approach with an auxiliary system ensuring that the states remain within prescribed bounds. Through error transformation, the virtual controller and the spacecraft attitude angular velocity are mapped to the free variables and a tracking controller is designed. Furthermore, an adaptive mechanism is integrated to estimate and compensate for unknown disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Finally, the stability of the system is analyzed using the Lyapunov method, which ensures the achievement of attitude consensus. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, data-driven learning based deep neural network (DNN) is the most dominant SOTA image dehazing framework. Here, learning to perfectly simulate the underlying mapping rules (from hazy to clear) told by massive paired training data is its core driving force. However, under genuine scenarios, it is extremely hard to guarantee the 100% qualification of all collected ground truth (GT) haze-free data. That’s because natural weather is hardly controlled, and many weathers are actually in a chaotic status existing between foggy and fog-free. Thus, unlike most supervised learning issues, the image dehazing society is born with the torture of part of faulty ground truth no-haze samples. Therefore, totally trusting training data and solely pursuing more fitting powerful data-driven model may not be a wise solution. To cope with this thorny challenge, in this paper, instead of faithfully pursuing for fitting capacity promotion, we on the contrary choose to intentionally cut down the fitting flexibility to achieve higher-level robustness. That is the LPATR-Net, a novel dehazing framework specially armed with fitting power suppression mechanism to resist intrinsic annoying faulty GT. This solution does not involve any extra manually labeling. Specifically, the LPATR-Net architecture is created completely around elaborately designed fitting-restrained learnable piecewise affine transformation regression. Since such low-order linear regression structure genetically can only fit for majority of data, the interference of minority of unqualified GT samples is expected to be effectively suppressed. Through further coupled with a highly customized multi-concerns high-accuracy dehazing fitting companion component, All-Mattering, proposed LPATR-Net elegantly achieves the seamless integration of traditional majority determining fixed-form regression and modern all freedom data-driven deep learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five commonly utilized public datasets to verify its effectiveness. In addition, the wide-range transplantability of the proposed core regression structure has also been experimentally confirmed. Source code is available at https://github.com/****/."

    "abstract": "Plug-and-play (PnP) image reconstruction methods leverage pretrained deep neural network denoisers as image priors to solve general inverse problems, and can obtain a competitive performance without having to train a network on a specific problem. Despite their flexibility, PnP methods often require several iterations to converge and their performance can be highly sensitive to the choice of the initialization and of the hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a new multilevel PnP framework to accelerate the convergence of PnP methods in the context of large-scale images. The proposed scheme, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, is initialized at the coarsest scale and the resolution of the starting point is progressively improved to reach the fine level with the highest resolution. The scheme then combines classical PnP iterations with cheaper iterations, involv ing representations of the images at coarser scales. As a result of the combination of these two ingredients, the multilevel PnP scheme accelerates the convergence and improves the robustness to the choice of initialization and hyperparameters. In a series of experiments, including image inpainting, demosaicing, and deblurring, we show that the proposed multilevel PnP method outperforms other PnP methods in both speed and reconstruction performance."

The bit error rate (BER) performance of the three modulation schemes is analyzed at different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) in a Rician fading channel (K = 10 dB) with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Through simulation, it is shown that BPSK has the lowest BER performance for any SNR value, indicating better immunity to noise and more reliable detection performance, while QPSK and 16-QAM have better spectral efficiency but higher BER due to noise sensitivity. This paper fills a gap in the existing literature by quantitatively addressing the trade-off between data rate and sensing reliability for PMCW-based Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems and can guide the design of modulation schemes for 6G network applications."

The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with intelligent data analytics enables real-time, non-invasive, and remote health monitoring which reduces the burden on healthcare systems while improving patient outcomes through timely interventions. Existing methods lack accuracy in processing high-dimensional sensor data, making them ineffective for continuous and personalized monitoring of vital signs. An IoT-driven health monitoring architecture was developed using eight body-worn sensors deployed on 303 patients to collect vital sign data, including pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory patterns, and cardiovascular activity. Feature extraction was carried out using a ResNet deep learning model to capture discriminative patterns in the sensor data. To reduce dimensionality and improve classification performance, feature optimization was conducted using an enhanced artificial flora optimization (EAFO) algorithm. The optimized features were then fed into a deep artificial neural network (DANN) for continuous monitoring of health status. Experimental results indicate that the proposed EAFO-DANN model achieves superior performance in detecting anomalies in vital sign data compared to conventional models. This framework represents a step forward in personalized and preventive medicine, enabling timely medical intervention and improving quality of life for patients through remote monitoring."

We formulate closed-form outage probability expressions for the legitimate user while accounting for destructive IRS combining at an eavesdropper. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical expressions. Results demonstrate that careful IRS phase and amplitude tuning significantly boosts secrecy rate while maintaining reliable legitimate performance.

If these applications are safety critical and operate in orbits with very harsh environments, traditional fault-tolerant architectures will not be able to detect/correct Double Event Upsets (DEUs). This paper proposes a multi-die Five Modular Redundancy (5MR) architecture with five replicas of the same module distributed on two dies. Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) are used to calculate the architecture reliability to find the best module distribution strategy in order to maximize lifetime, taking into account available FPGA resources. A case study is presented, and it shows that splitting the modules between two dies of different technologies/failure rates produces a higher reliability than a traditional Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture (which cannot detect DEUs) or a 5MR architecture with all 5 modules housed on the newer technology die."

Such methods as data augmentation, regularization, early stopping were used to improve the generalization of the model. The CNN model with the best performance obtained an test accuracy of 99.64% and the other models were equally well performing.

In this context, we are interested in developing efficient algorithms for real-time detection and prevention of fake accounts for the privacy of users (e.g., celebrities) and to reduce impersonation risks. As a first contribution, we collected an accurate dataset of public figures from different data sources. Each record has been labeled and tagged with the appropriate attributes to ensure that the algorithm can accurately distinguish between real and fake data. This initial step allowed us to create a comprehensive dataset to train algorithms to recognize and find such data online is either not feasible or unavailable in open-source formats due to the inclusion of personal information. Our data set comprises 1,400 carefully selected personal data records, mainly from celebrities, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing. The second contribution is an algorithm that leverages a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to analyze data entered during account creation, determining whether the information is legitimate or not. Our study evaluates and compares five main algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF).

Spammers use loopholes to share malicious content and capture private details, such as contacts and files, and pose a severe threat to companies and individuals. Unsolicited emails, such as spam and phishing, have a significant negative impact and cost a huge amount each year. Several models and methods have been introduced to automatically classify spam, and none have succeeded in predicting spam with a success rate of 100%. Since spam continues to evolve, traditional systems have not been able to keep up, and therefore there is a strong focus on more reliable alternatives. Potential directions for improving spam detection come from recent developments in deep learning and word embedding methods. Word embeddings, or text-to-machine-readable forms, have proved to be critical in improving model performance. Natural language processing (NLP) further improves detection performance. In this field, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have performed better. With these new techniques, our goal is to create more effective and reliable filtering systems that address unwanted email challenges and protect consumers from related risks."

    "abstract": "To improve the overall energy efficiency and to address the co-optimization challenges of photovoltaic power generation, this paper proposes a co-optimization control strategy based on the Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA). First, models of the photovoltaic array's output characteristics under varying environmental conditions and the Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer Cell(PEMEC) electrochemical efficiency are established to reveal the dynamic coupling between power input and hydrogen production. To overcome the limitations of conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms — such as susceptibility to local optima and slow dynamic response—an improved SSA algorithm integrating Tent chaotic mapping and adaptive control mechanisms is proposed. Chaotic initialization enhances population diversity, while leader chaotic perturbation and follower adaptive weighting strategies are incorporated to strengthen the algorithm's global search capability. Simulation results show that, under 25°C and 800 W/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> irradiance, the proposed algorithm achieves an MPPT tracking accuracy of 99.1%, increases steady-state output power by 388.3 W, and reduces response time to 0.17 s, significantly outperforming the traditional SSA algorithm. Moreover, the improved algorithm effectively suppresses power fluctuations, resulting in faster dynamic response and more stable hydrogen production. Consequently, the system's overall energy utilization efficiency is substantially enhanced. The study demonstrates that the proposed ISSA-based co-optimization strategy enables efficient coordination between photovoltaic power generation and the PEM electrolyzer."

By focusing on English teachers in China, especially in Shanghai, the study aims to analyze ways in which AI can be utilized to support professional development in improving teaching strategies and in engendering adaptability for adult education settings. This study employs a qualitative methodology of conducting semi-structured interviews among English teachers to determine their experiences, perceptions, and challenges regarding using AI tools. Thematic analysis was made to identify the key patterns and insights from the interviews, which indicate that using ChatGPT improves lesson planning, content creation, and engages learners with it to support teachers in addressing diverse student needs. In addition, the findings indicate some barriers that involve less technical and sufficient resources availability. Targeted training programs with the support of institutions are thus crucial for implementing these changes. This paper contributes to the increasing body of work on AI in education by focusing on the potential of ChatGPT in professional development for teachers in China.

    "abstract": "Driven by the goal of \" dual-carbon \" , wind-photovoltaic- electricity- hydrogen hybrid energy storage microgrids have become an important carrier to enhance the capacity of new energy consumption. Aiming at the problem of renewable energy fluctuation and uncertainty affecting the safety and health of energy storage equipment, a wind-power-hydrogen hybrid energy storage microgrid optimal scheduling model considering the health management of energy storage equipment is proposed. Firstly, a typical scenario of wind-electricity-equivalent uncertainty is established by using the Latin Hypercube algorithm and the K-means clustering algorithm. Secondly, the operating characteristics of battery, electrolyzer and fuel cell are analyzed, and the optimal scheduling model considering the health management of energy storage equipment is established by taking minimizing the operating cost, equipment health loss cost and penalty cost as the objective function, and finally, the Cplex solver is invoked to solve the model based on Matlab. The example results show that the method can effectively balance the economy with equipment safety and health, extend the service life of the energy storage equipment, and improve the operation efficiency of the microgrid."

    "abstract": "In the digital age, biometric authentication has be-come a vital security measure, and keystroke dynamics provides an affordable and intuitive behavioral biometric solution. The introduction of generative models based on deep learning, how-ever, raises questions about how resistant they are to spoofing. In this paper, the viability of using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to perform presentation attacks on keystroke dynamics is investigated. In order to produce artificial typing patterns that resemble real users without the need for explicit conditioning, we design and test three GAN variants: CNN-GAN, LSTM-GAN, and Vanilla-GAN. Three datasets were used for the experiments: a multi-sentence paragraph with rephrased content, an arbitrary sentence, and a fixed-length password string. A Siamese Neural Network (SNN) authenticator that had already been trained was used to evaluate the produced samples. In every dataset, GANs were able to replicate user-specific typing rhythms and fool the SNN. When it came to accuracy, the LSTMGAN consistently performed the best (95–96%), followed closely by CNN-GAN (92–94%), and Vanilla-GAN (80–87%). Crucially, synthetic keystrokes were indistinguishable from real patterns, even in intricate free-text and paragraph scenarios. These results underline a serious flaw in keystroke-based authentication and the pressing need for strong defences against presentation attack powered by GANs."

    "abstract": "The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has gained widespread adoption in high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems due to its superior output waveform quality, modular configuration, and excellent scalability. There are a large number of power switches in MMCs, meaning that each one can be a potential point of failure. This abnormality can distort the MMC output voltage and current and may even damage the MMC. Therefore, diagnosing open-circuit faults in MMCs is very important for the stable, safe, and reliable operation of the system. In practical applications, the actual characteristics of the sensor (such as drift, stability, etc.) will introduce sensor noise. Due to noise interference in MMCs, the submodule capacitor voltage easily exceeds the threshold, resulting to false alarms. An noise-corrected 3σ criterion-based open-circuit fault localization method is proposed. The threshold is corrected in this method, taking into account the characteristics of the faulty submodule capacitor voltage and the influence of sensor noise. By comparing the submodule capacitor voltage with the corrected threshold, the faulty submodule can be quickly located. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate localization of faulty SMs with strong robustness against noise interference."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques are now absolutely essential for raising the accuracy of specialized domain large language models. This work presents GitaGPT, a novel Question Answering system developed to combine generative artificial intelligence with advanced retrieval methods to offer authoritative interpretations of the Bhagavad Gita. Unlike traditional methods depending just on quick engineering or model fine-tuning, our technique uses a complex two-stage process. First, the most pertinent scripture texts are found via a custom-built retrieval module using cosine similarity and specialized text embedding. Second, these parts give the LLaMA-3.2 language model contextual anchors to generate doctrinally correct responses. Our comprehensive study reveals clear benefits over current methods, with a 40% drop in factual errors comparing to typical implementations. Constructed using open-source tools such as ChromaDB and LlamaIndex, the system architecture offers best performance with 512-token chunks, therefore balancing response latency under 1.5 seconds with retrieval accuracy (0.85 MRR). Theological experts confirmed the output quality; 94% of the responses fit accepted scriptural readings. This approach not only improves conversational artificial intelligence for religious literature but also provides a general structure for other knowledge-intensive disciplines demanding factual accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a multi-source auto power supply system that ensures continuous efficient power delivery. The system enables automatic selection between solar panels, batteries, and fuel cells when each source becomes available and the load needs adjustment. The system operates through a central microcontroller, which manages the source usage based on defined operation criteria and system limitations. Load requirements get met through output stabilization achieved by DC-DC converters, which harmonize fluctuating voltage sources. The control strategies implemented in the system enable distribution of the load efficiently while guaranteeing system reliability during a wide range of operating scenarios. Experimental results together with simulation data demonstrate the system effectiveness, thus making it suitable for renewable energy management and off-grid systems and industrial automation applications. This system design provides energy-efficient capabilities together with cost reduction and reliability improvements, which advance autonomous sustainable power supply risk mitigation implementations through microcontroller and relay device implementation. The system moves to the subsequent priority generator from the original power source if the first generator stops operating. The LEDs used in that source allow users to monitor when that power supply becomes operational."

This paper presents a life prediction method for sodium-ion batteries based on a double-exponential equation model. By analyzing the capacity retention rate data of sodium-ion batteries and applying the double-exponential equation for curve fitting and predictive modeling, the service life of these batteries is successfully estimated. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively characterizes the capacity retention decay behavior over charge-discharge cycles and enables reasonably accurate life prediction. Although the model has certain limitations, it offers a rapid and straightforward approach for battery life assessment, providing valuable support for battery manufacturers. This approach holds significant potential in the field of battery lifespan prediction and serves as a reliable basis for quantitative life evaluation."

Typically, with conventional systems, signals are controlled by operator intervention, making it sensitive to fatigue, and it is based on subjective decision. To improve the processing of real time stream of videos to identify suspicious patterns this project applies deep learning methodologies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that derive spatial representations from unique video frames and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that perceive time dependence in sequences of frames are the central components of the system. Therefore, it is important to combine to identify the complex tasks increasing with time. In case of some abnormal activity the system displays red colored rectangles with rest of the region being black around such persons, and also raises the alarm. Since it is trained on labeled normal and suspicious activities, this makes the model trained capable of any form of a practical application. There are multiple strategies, which are used to enhance the results: This work deals with data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning. It is confirmed by evaluation measures such as precision, recall rate, F1-score, and accuracy that the proposed system is effective. The mass and cost effectiveness of this project provides a solution to reducing the need for manual monitoring and increasing the amount of time spent addressing threats. Deep learning proved its power to innovate surveillance and improve security with widespread usage throughout public security, crime fighting, and protecting critical infrastructure."

To overcome the SGA algorithm's tendency for local optima due to random initialization, improvements are made in initialization methods, weight factors, and running trajectory to enhance optimization. Additionally, to reduce randomness in WNN model training caused by random initialization of translation/expansion factors, an ISGA algorithm optimizes WNN parameters, improving accuracy and stability. Results demonstrate high prediction accuracy for effluent COD failures."

    "abstract": "With the progress of smart transport and vehicular networks, protecting data privacy and the security of user communication has become increasingly important. This paper presents a fresh approach to a blockchain-based architecture which maintains the privacy of vehicle users when interacting with smart applications. Current vehicular networks have serious limitations around centralized data and management approaches: they are prone to data tampering and unauthorized access. The method presented in this study combines decentralized records and cryptographic tools to store sensitive user data so that the data is protected while enabling access control and authentication. Smart contracts are used to automate transaction validation against intended privacy policies without Transactional intermediaries. The system architecture facilitates anonymized vehicular data access to only authorized users, which will help mitigate the opportunities for identity exposure and abuse of data. The verification method proposed is shown here to have low latency, to be scalable, and trustworthy; regardless of a reasonably common threat through a network attack. The experimental analysis shows the method presented can be trustworthy, achieve data integrity, data privacy, and access that can be trusted in real time. This method is a potential step towards building smart transport systems that open up the potential of multi-hop vehicular networks through blockchain technology."

    "abstract": "Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has been widely applied in industrial fault diagnosis due to the advantages in small-sample learning and interoperability. However, most existing GCN-based methods are trained using measured data, with limited integration of prior knowledge. Moreover, prior knowledge-based methods are often trained under a single operating condition, limiting their applicability in highly dynamic industrial environments such as metallurgical and rolling mills. In such cases, a single prior knowledge approach struggles to cover all operating conditions. These challenges hinder the application of GCN in industrial settings. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for induction motor fault diagnosis based on an improved GCN. Specifically, the method first utilizes prior knowledge to perform a preliminary fault diagnosis and construct an association graph based on the diagnostic results. Then, two subnetworks are trained using fault data under two representative motor load conditions (high and low). A dynamic observer is designed to estimate the real-time operating load of the motor. Finally, the two subnetworks are integrated to form a complete GCN model that covers the full load range. This diagnostic framework effectively integrates prior knowledge and GCN, achieving superior performance compared to existing fault diagnosis methods in experiments. In particular, under varying operating conditions, the proposed method demonstrates better diagnostic performance than other deep learning approaches and unmodified GCN models."

    "abstract": "Identification and authentication are major challenges in our society. Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) has been in use for more than twenty years. However, authentication usually requires complex digital systems, such as crypto-processors, which significantly increase the cost of the end device. These techniques remain incompatible with many applications where cost is critical. This paper presents preliminary work describing how a transponder at 13.56 MHz can be designed to enable authentication between a fixed reader and a full passive and analogue tag. The antenna is based on an inductive loop, similar to any Near-Field Communication (NFC) tag. The incoming Amplitude Modulated (AM) wave is rectified to provide power to a chaotic system based on a Duffing resonator. The produced chaotic signal is then used to modulate the load connected to the loop antenna to produce a chaotic but deterministic back-scattered signal that can be authenticated by the fixed reader."

This survey synthesizes recent machine-learning advances for RIS-aided communications, focusing on: (i) channel estimation and CSI compression with deep and physics-informed models; (ii) RIS configuration and joint active–passive beamforming via reinforcement learning and discrete/combinatorial optimization; and (iii) sensing, localization, and ISAC that exploit RIS-induced spatial diversity. After a concise system-model primer (passive vs. hybrid-active RIS, near- vs. far-field, wideband OFDM, discrete phase quantization), we organize methods by task and compare them under unified metrics—accuracy, sample complexity, inference latency, and robustness to mobility, blockage, and hardware impairments. We also review prototypes and case studies, emphasizing controller architectures, compute budgets, and real-time constraints. The paper concludes with open challenges and a research agenda, highlighting gaps in sim-to-real transfer, safe and uncertainty-aware control, handling non-stationarity, near-field/wideband coupling, and standardized interfaces (e.g., O-RAN) for deployment. By mapping tasks to techniques and practical constraints, the survey offers a compact guide to what works, where, and why—aimed at accelerating robust, reproducible RIS-enabled 6G systems."

Human Activity Recognition plays an important role in various domains such as surveillance, sports, security, and healthcare. Still, existing human activity recognition systems often face difficulties in real-world, low-light environments, which are essential in real-world surveillance scenarios. This study addressed and solved this obstacle by using the lightweight, low-light-condition-suited MobileNet model on the ARID v1.5 dataset. ARID v1.5 is a challenging video dataset that contains a total 3,784 video clips from 11 activity categories, specially designed for low-light conditions, in contrast to University of Central Floriad101 dataset, which is a popular benchmark for Human Activity Recognition and focuses on well-lit and controlled environments. MobileNet, is a lightweight model which is optimized for mobile and edge devices, offered an effective balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency. After being improved with more layers to improve performance, the model is then customized. So, basically, based on experimental results, MobileNet using UCF101 dataset achieved 98.47% accuracy and MobileNet's 76.35% accuracy on the ARID v1.5 dataset showed that it is appropriate for detecting persons in dim lit or in dark environments and also created a benchmark because no prior experiments have been done before on this dataset."

    "abstract": "The study presented a multi-faceted big data analytics model, which employs the Random Forest prediction model to forecast the levels of audience engagement to assist in making specific film distribution choices. The framework examines trends by bringing together various datasets, such as box office data, streaming data, demographics, and social media to determine the most viable geographic locations and platforms to release. Random Forest model is used to assign interest level of a user and predict the possible viewership based on the past performance indicators and sentiment information. At the same time, social media posts, including tweets, posts, hashtags, and interactions with influencers, will be processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to retrieve the sentiment polarity, the frequency of engagement, and thematic alignments. These learnings are applied in real-time to optimise the promotional creative, timing and platform targeting to achieve the greatest reach and optimise the budget. The system also uses the techniques of clustering the audience groups and establishing the alignment of the content according to the behavioural and psychographic attributes. The framework enables data-based decision-making regarding both the conventional and digital distribution channel by combining predictive modelling with social feedback analysis. The modular design provides scalability in independent film campaigns and large-scale movie campaigns and can provide actionable intelligence to movie producers, distributors, and marketers. Finally, this method allows showing how machine learning and big data can transform promotional and distribution approaches in the entertainment business, resulting in better economic returns and viewer satisfaction."

    "abstract": "We present a novel cross-domain application of AI-enhanced medical imaging techniques for intelligent fault diagnostics in smart grid infrastructure. We introduce FusionScan-AI, an image processing pipeline originally developed for enhancing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, and adapt it for visual analysis of electrical components such as transformers, switchgear, and power distribution units. The pipeline consists of three core stages: deep learning–based denoising, adaptive contrast enhancement, and edge sharpening via convolutional filters. These stages collectively improve the clarity of noisy, low-contrast thermal and visual sensor data. By simulating these enhancements on infrared thermographic images of substation and high-voltage equipment, we show that latent faults such as insulation degradation, connector overheating, and structural anomalies become more detectable. Drawing on proven success in detecting tumors and microlesions in medical contexts, we demonstrate the transferability of these techniques to autonomous fault detection in the smart grid. Our results support the feasibility of using AI-based medical imaging pipelines for condition monitoring in distributed energy systems, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and predictive maintenance strategies in next-generation power networks."

    "abstract": "In industrial equipment maintenance, acoustic monitoring offers an effective non-contact approach for anomaly detection. However, deep learning-based methods typically require large quantities of high-quality labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in real-world industrial environments due to equipment heterogeneity, data sensitivity, and the high cost of manual annotation. To address the challenges posed by the increasing diversity of equipment types and the growing volume of unlabeled data, this paper proposes an anomaly sound detection method based on a teacher–student framework that operates without access to source data. Pre-trained teacher models are used to perform inference on unlabeled acoustic data, and a statistical filtering mechanism based on anomaly scores is employed to generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. These pseudo-labels guide the student model to learn the predictive distribution of the teacher models. Experiments conducted on the MIMII dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong detection performance without relying on source data or labeled samples, reaching an average AUC of 87.79% and pAUC of 81.58%."

The research examines the evolution of secular governance, with a particular focus on India’s multicultural and pluralistic model, illustrating how diverse political frameworks influence the adoption of AI and public trust in it. It argues that the effective utilisation of AI requires reassessing public sector practices, developing robust governance frameworks, and prioritising citizen participation, digital literacy, and capacity-building to ensure equitable access to AI. Interdisciplinary collaboration and international cooperation are identified as essential for creating resilient AI governance models. Looking ahead to 2050, the study calls for a balanced strategy that aligns AI’s transformative potential with democratic principles and citizens’ rights, ensuring that technological innovation contributes to the common good and effectively addresses societal challenges.

Tests conducted on real-world operational data from a thermal power plant demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of air preheater outlet monitoring variables. Furthermore, by providing predictive uncertainty estimates, it offers more reliable guidance for power plant operations.

This work is a study of a Generative AI-based framework for the creation of dynamic, individualized digital narratives geared toward improving ideological and political education while dealing with ethical risks. The proposed methodology is Deep Q Network (DQN)-driven reinforcement learning technique that modifies the narrative elements depending on user engagement metrics, cognitive load, and how they align with core educational values. By using large scale pre-trained language models and training them within pedagogical setting the system does not only achieve contextual relevance but also ideological fidelity. The hybrid rubric used to assess digital narratives integrates semantic coherence, value conformity, and emotional resonance. A multi-armed experimental set up across university level political education courses is used to measure efficacy. Results indicate that the AI-created content greatly enhances student understanding, retention, critical thought as compared to traditional passive materials. Furthermore, the integrated ethical risk assessment successfully filters biased or inappropriate outputs through the rule-based and probabilistic verification layers. The adaptive capacity of the model even provides live narrative tweaks based on changing student reaction and curriculum movements."

Diode configurations with variations in anode geometry, thickness, and material were explored, including round, tapered, and monolithic polyethylene and Mylar designs. The ion fluence and current enclosed profiles were extracted to assess the quality of the beam across the anode surface. The results show that dual-anode planar geometries produce promising ion beam uniformities, with the most uniform case yielding a coefficient of variation of 10.62%. Round-edge designs mitigate magnetic field losses at anode tips, while thinner anodes enhance ion production through increased electron reflexing. These findings support the use of planar diodes in high-uniformity ion beam environments for materials testing applications."

    "abstract": "Transformers have shown remarkable performance in 3D medical image segmentation, but their high computational requirements and need for large amounts of labeled data limit their applicability. To address these challenges, we consider two crucial aspects: model efficiency and data efficiency. Specifically, we propose Light-UNETR, a lightweight transformer designed to achieve model efficiency. Light-UNETR features a Lightweight Dimension Reductive Attention (LIDR) module, which reduces spatial and channel dimensions while capturing both global and local features via multi-branch attention. Additionally, we introduce a Compact Gated Linear Unit (CGLU) to selectively control channel interaction with minimal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Contextual Synergic Enhancement (CSE) learning strategy, which aims to boost the data efficiency of Transformers. It first leverages the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">extrinsic contextual information</i> to support the learning of unlabeled data with Attention-Guided Replacement, then applies Spatial Masking Consistency that utilizes <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">intrinsic contextual information</i> to enhance the spatial context reasoning for unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both performance and efficiency. For example, with only 10% labeled data on the Left Atrial Segmentation dataset, our method surpasses BCP by 1.43% Jaccard while drastically reducing the FLOPs by 90.8% and parameters by 85.8%.

    "abstract": "In FSO communication links employing conventional Gaussian beams, power loss can become an issue due to the divergence nature of a Gaussian beam. This issue becomes more severe when the Rx aperture is relatively small and/or the link length varies. Additionally, atmospheric turbulence can further degrade the link performance by causing beam wandering and scintillation. In this paper, we use a “pin-like” beam to mitigate the adverse effects of limited aperture, variable link length, and turbulence in an FSO communication link. The beam rapidly contracts upon transmission and keeps a small size over a relatively long distance. Experimental results show the pin-like beam's diameter converges from 7 mm to < 1 mm upon 0.6-m propagation, resulting in average power loss reduction of > 3.6 dB compared to a Gaussian beam at different distances (0.6 m and 0.9 m) and with different Rx aperture diameters (1 mm and 3 mm), in the presence of turbulence effects emulated by a phase plate of r<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> = 1 mm. This improvement translates to reduced BER and outage probability in a 2-Gbit/s OOK link. As an example, under a 3-mm-diameter Rx aperture, using the pin-like beam achieves error-free transmission in 40000 symbols for 100 random turbulence realizations, while the Gaussian beam has a 3% outage probability (BER > 3.8e-3). We further simulate a 1.5-km FSO link to compare the pin-like beam with the regular Gaussian beam and focused Gaussian beams with different focal lengths. Results reveal that, while a focused Gaussian beam may have low turbulence-induced power loss at its focal point, the pin-like beam delivers consistent performance across the link."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning is a critical approach for robots to acquire skills by mimicking human behavior. However, traditional imitation learning frameworks often exhibit poor action prediction accuracy and low robustness when handling complex tasks. To tackle these limitations, we propose the PIDiff policy that integrates an enhanced linear-complexity Transformer with a diffusion model and introduces a PointNet-based encoder to efficiently extract visual features, thereby enhancing the policy's understanding of the environment and improving learning efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we introduce the designed SubLink Block and CrossLink Block, enabling the improved Transformer to serve as the noise predictor in the diffusion strategy while retaining the diffusion model's ability to capture multi-modal distributions. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted systematic experiments across multiple tasks on three robotic manipulation benchmark platforms in simulation environments and performed evaluations in various real-world scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher success rates, faster inference speeds, reduced GPU memory usage, and enhanced robustness."

However, current techniques and prototypes have yet to achieve fully interactive, battery-free functionality. This paper presents a battery-free interactive gaming system powered by energy harvested from transient fingertip motion. To ensure the reactivity, interactivity, and stability of the fingertip motion harvester (FMH), we employ a multistable structure. The FMH unit provides a reliable energy solution by utilizing precharged potential energy within dynamically varying potential wells. Additionally, the integration of a bistable screen design facilitates seamless gaming experiences, decouples game logic from user interface mechanics, and ensures rapid system recovery after power interruptions. Beyond advancing fundamental research, this work pioneers a practical battery-free interaction paradigm based on fingertip motion, with potential for broader battery-free user interfaces and low-power interactive systems."

A force/torque-calculation-based (FCB) observer is designed to estimate the rotor faulty factor. Combining the estimated information, an attitude controller and a velocity controller are developed to address the LOE fault. These controllers are designed to theoretically ensure that the CTR-eVTOL maintains stable flight and achieves fault-tolerant control even when confronted with a 100% LOE fault in one rotor. To further illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, ground bench tests involving comparative controllers and a real-time flight experiment are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed fault-tolerant control strategy can effectively address the LOE fault, enhancing the safety of the CTR-eVTOL during flight."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of e-commerce and urban logistics has intensified the challenges associated with last-mile delivery, necessitating the integration of autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), drones, and smart micro-hubs for cost-effective and sustainable operations. This study introduces a novel Multi-Depot Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Multi-Modal Transportation (MD-CVRPTW-MM), where deliveries are dynamically assigned to either ADVs or drones while optimizing hub locations and vehicle routing. The objective is to minimize total operational costs, including transportation, hub activation, and delivery mode selection, while ensuring service-level constraints such as time windows and capacity limits. To efficiently solve this complex combinatorial problem, we propose a mathematical formulation enhanced with valid inequalities for computational efficiency. Furthermore, a Branch-and-Price algorithm is developed, where column generation is employed to iteratively refine delivery routes while enforcing depot assignments and mode selection constraints. The solution approach integrates dual stabilization techniques and path-based heuristics to accelerate convergence. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets and real-world logistics scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing last-mile delivery costs, optimizing fleet utilization, and enhancing service reliability. The results highlight the significance of multi-modal last-mile delivery optimization in improving urban logistics and sustainability. This research contributes a new mathematical model, efficient optimization techniques, and practical insights for intelligent last-mile delivery planning in smart cities."

Text-to-speech technology-processed voice alerts provide enhanced situational awareness and human-quality engagement while alerting residents or security personnel. The system is deployable in secure locations, homes, and offices, and it is reasonably priced and expandable.

This paper presents a weighted multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem in a hybrid-NOMA assisted SAGIN. We aim to optimize user clusters, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) position, and the power splitting factor, for maximizing the network sum rate (NSR) and the UAV cluster serving efficiency (CSE). We include non-linear energy harvesting (EH) for UAV’s power constraints, and we model the UAV-user link using the fluctuating two-ray (FTR) fading model. Owing to the intractability of the problem, we decompose it into two parts- the user clustering subproblem and the joint UAV positioning and power splitting factor subproblem. A novel and modified preference relation algorithm (PRA) is presented to solve the first subproblem. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted for the second subproblem. Our algorithms result in a 43% increase in the NSR and a 90% increase in the objective function. Finally, we implement an alternative optimization (AO) that runs the algorithms iteratively to further double the achieved NSR. Our solutions are tested via Monte-Carlo simulations and the applicability and scalability are quantified."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged in communication networks as a response to its increasing integration and proliferation, shaping new ways of communication where more intelligent systems and processes become interconnected and automated. The dissemination of IoT gadgets in communication networks, however, is associated with major security issues, such as unauthorized access, leaked data, and damaging attacks affecting the integrity of essential infrastructure. The conventional security solutions are not generally sufficient for the requirements of IoT as the resource constrained, dynamic topology, and decentralised operation make the deployment of the normal security measures inappropriate in IoT environments. This paper presents a blockchain-based security architecture designed for IoT and 5G enabled smart communication networks. It uses the decentralized and tamper-proof characteristic of blockchain to solve the main security problems in IoT, including secure authentication, data integrity, privacy, and secure communication. With blockchain technology, the RF devices in the network can securely verify each other, guarantee that the data transmitted is correct by checking for authenticity, and eliminate the possibility of communications tampering, although some nodes can be potentially compromised. There is no central authority holding blockchain, and it minimizes the points of failure, and it is resilient. Moreover, smart contracts can automate the security mechanisms, which increase the efficiency of the operations and reduce information dependency. Also swept in the introduced framework are lightweight consensus mechanisms of resource-constraint IoT device, in order that security solutions are unlikely to affect the performance of the network. Moreover, the blockchain is traceable and it is easy to know what occurred and when and can be used to hold accountability and assist in the rapid detection of violations. This article presents a single solution to the secure-IoT-enabled intelligent wireless communication networks by examining the benefits of the blockchain technology and IoT security requirements, which enhance efficiently the reliability, privacy, and scalability of IoT platforms in real life."

    "abstract": "In the intelligentization process of open-pit mines, the detection of safety hazard targets is confronted with technical challenges, including blurred features of small targets, extreme multi-scale distribution of targets, and severe background interference under complex working conditions. An improved lightweight safety hazard target detection algorithm for open-pit mines is proposed based on RT-DETR. Firstly, the lightweight PConv-Block module is incorporated into the backbone feature extraction network, which precisely captures the features of every safety hazard while notably lowering the model’s computational complexity. Secondly, by combining multi-scale feature fusion with the Slimneck structure, the Slimneck-SSFF cross-scale feature fusion framework is proposed; this framework not only enhances adaptability to safety hazards of different scales but also reduces the network computational load. Finally, the GIoU loss function is adopted, and detection accuracy is significantly improved through dynamic adjustment of weight allocation for hard-to-detect safety hazard samples. Test findings show that, compared with the original RT-DETR model, the enhanced version sees a 30% drop in parameter quantity, while its mAP50 metric hits 91.7%. These outcomes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting safety hazards in open-pit mines."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that requires early diagnosis for effective treatment. Deep learning-based facial image classification models have demonstrated significant potential for automated autism diagnosis. Nevertheless, the black box nature of the model limits its application for clinical adoption. This paper presents a novel approach to a hybrid model framework that enhances the interpretability of deep learning models by combining visual interpretability with natural language processing. The model utilizes Grad-Cam-based heatmaps with facial landmarks-based region segmentation to indicate salient areas such as the eyes, nose, and mouth that influence classification. In this pilot study, the identified regions are mapped to predefined linguistic templates using a rule-based explanation module, while the full framework proposes a transformer-based natural language generation model for future implementation. This heatmap-to-text pipeline bridges the gap between AI decision-making and clinical reasoning, achieving 80 percent accuracy on a small dataset. Interpreting heatmaps requires technical expertise, and a human-readable explanation improves clinical decision-making. The proposed approach enhances user understanding, clinician trust, and early autism screening accessibility in real-world healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "Forecasting stock price movements is a complex task due to the dynamic behavior of financial markets and the interdependencies among various economic and behavioral factors. Existing models often fail to jointly capture temporal dependencies, feature relevance, and structural relationships among multiple stocks, particularly when integrating multimodal data such as sentiment and market indicators. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture TDAGNN-SAGE that combines a dual attention mechanism with a topology aware Graph SAGE framework to enhance predictive performance. Our approach leverages multimodal financial data including time series stock indicators, market index features and sentiment scores extracted using FinBERT from daily news headlines. The dual attention module captures both temporal and feature-level relevance, while the graph component models inter stock correlations using a static correlation based adjacency matrix. We further employed SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to analyze feature importance and enhance model interpretability. We evaluated our model using data from five publicly traded companies listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). The result shows that our approach consistently performs better than traditional methods such as CNN, BiLSTM, BiGRU, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. TDAGNN-SAGE achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1353 and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.9665.

Twenty-two healthy participants were tested under VR and MR conditions, and HRV parameters were analyzed in both time and frequency domains, as well as using nonlinear methods, including Poincaré plots, entropy measures, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Results indicate that VR exposure elicits a stronger sympathetic response, characterized by reduced MeanRR, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50%, decreased HF power, increased LF power and LF/HF ratio, and reduced nonlinear complexity (SD1, SD2, ApEn, SampEn, α<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>, α<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) compared to MR.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are widely viewed as a key enabler for 6G thanks to their ability to reshape propagation for higher spectral efficiency, extended coverage, and improved reliability. Conventional passive RIS deployments, however, typically depend on a dedicated control or backhaul link to the base station (BS), which constrains placement flexibility and adds integration cost. This paper studies an autonomous, semi-active RIS that dispenses with an explicit BS–RIS control link: the RIS locally senses uplink/downlink pilots, updates its phases on-device, and closes the loop via reinforcement learning. We design an observation-driven Double-Dqn controller that uses a DFT-based action set and a reward computed directly from RIS observations, requiring no explicit downlink CSI. To obtain compact state features, pilot snapshots are compressed with an OMP-based angular dictionary; downlink performance is evaluated with MMSE precoding. Using a common training recipe (replay, target network, advantage rewards), we compare two bands representative of current and near-term systems 3 GHz (sub-6 GHz, 5G) and 7.8 GHz (upper mid-band, 6G). Across both bands, the observation-reward agent consistently converges and tracks an reference agent trained with perfect-CSI rewards, while markedly outperforming random baselines. Results indicate that future RIS setups can be self-optimizing and frequency-robust without a dedicated BS–RIS control link."

    "abstract": "Tool wear prediction is crucial in manufacturing, as tool degradation affects production efficiency, product quality, and operational costs. Traditional methods, relying on empirical or physics-based analyses, often fail to address complex non-linearities and varying operational conditions. An ensemble LSTM–Transformer encoder (ELSTM-TE) hybrid architecture is proposed for tool wear prediction. LSTM captures temporal dependencies, while Transformer enhances global feature extraction through multi-head attention. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach is integrated to reduce noise and improve robustness. Experiments on the PHM2010 milling benchmark indicate that ELSTM-TE achieves lower prediction error than several recurrent and convolutional baselines. These results show that the proposed model can reliably estimate tool wear under complex and noisy operating conditions, and thus has good potential for integration into tool-health monitoring systems."

When constructing dynamic graphs, the model incorporates prior knowledge that conforms to the operation mode between equipment in actual industrial processes. At the same time, the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) constructed using the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem is used to diagnose possible faults. Finally, the effectiveness of KFGNN was validated on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset, and it exhibited more satisfactory performance compared to other baseline models."

This study helps us to understand the deep concern related to colon cancer by utilizing explainable AI for detection and prediction. The major areas of conclusion are early detection after the screening, finding the associated risk, and final decision-making. This review highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the earlier proposed literature reviews by employing XAI for prognosis and Diagnosis. Furthermore, it discusses the challenges associated with and future research that can be made out of it. The ethical and legal consideration of colon cancer is also examined in the article.

While prior research has primarily focused on single-client reverse shell detection or post-compromise analysis, few studies address the architectural and operational challenges of multi-client reverse shell scenarios. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for implementing and evaluating multi-client reverse shell attacks in a controlled environment. The proposed system employs a threaded, socket-based server architecture capable of maintaining concurrent sessions with multiple client agents by using Python. We analyze realistic attack vectors, including social engineering delivery methods such as phishing and baiting, and implement a custom communication protocol for secure and reliable command execution. Performance testing demonstrates the system’s ability to maintain stable, responsive connections under various client loads. Our study highlights the limitations of conventional firewalls and intrusion detection systems in detecting such attacks and provides insights into mitigation strategies, including behavioral analysis and zero-trust architecture. The simulation platform serves as a valuable tool for education, red teaming, and future research into advanced threat detection and defense mechanisms."

    "abstract": "In the age of digital communication, the need to securely and unobtrusively transmit sensitive data is critically important. Image steganography is a useful way to store information in images imperceptibly. Nonetheless, the classical algorithm of hidden-data carving usually hardly keeps the delicate balance of invisibility, payload and robustness. Motivated by these drawbacks StegoGAN, a novel GAN-based steganography framework is proposed to improve quality and security of the communication. The proposed method employs deep neural networks as base to hide secret messages into a cover image adaptively and imperceptibly. The proposed method is comprised of a generator, which is trained to encode a given secret message into a realistic stego image, a discriminator which discriminates real images and stego images for the generation of visually better stego images, and a decoder, which aims to recover the secret message in a lossless manner. The model is trained with a loss that incorporates adversarial loss, reconstruction loss and perceptual similarity measurements which can guarantee visual quality and message recovery. The experimental results show that the proposed novel StegoGAN achieves better imperceptibility, capacity and robustness than traditional methods. This work creates new opportunities in secure visual communication and provides one promising step toward combining deep learning with information hiding."

Using IRS elements reconfigurability and the allocation of transmitted power to NOMA users, our goal is to dynamically adjust phase shifts and power factors to enhance legitimate channel conditions while simultaneously mitigating the eavesdropper’s influence. We formulate the secrecy capacity maximization and design a double-DQL framework that is developed to efficiently explore the high-dimensional state-action space, enabling the agent to converge towards policies that maximize long-term secrecy performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDQL-based scheme outperforms DQL approaches, achieving significant improvements in secrecy capacity in various channel scenarios and key system parameters.

The most prominent themes emerging from the literature were natural language querying and text-to-SQL translation. To facilitate comparative analysis and provide a consolidated overview of the BI–LLM landscape, this review offers a shareable, coded dataset. The findings suggest that LLMs currently enhance the user-interaction layer of BI. Although applications remain limited, research activity in this area has grown significantly, highlighting both the opportunities and the lack of systematic integration of LLMs into BI workflows. Existing studies are largely exploratory and methodologically fragmented, emphasizing the need for integrated conceptual frameworks and robust empirical evidence.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robustness and performance of chipless RFID technology for identification and tracking, emphasizing its localization capabilities in dynamic and challenging warehouse environments. We examine how chipless tags placed on the ground can facilitate and enhance the realtime localization of autonomous guided vehicles. An evaluation of chipless RFID tags under harsh electromagnetic conditions, including moisture, dust, and physical obstructions, demonstrates their reliability in challenging environments. A co-polarized bistatic antenna pair, mounted on a tilted support, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing specular reflections, thereby improving detection performance. The impact of the tag's tilt orientation and translational movement on location accuracy is also analyzed. Dynamic measurements are conducted for two tag orientations: inclined placement (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\phi=30^{\\circ}$</tex>) and flat placement (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\phi=0^{\\circ}$</tex>). These measurements assess detection performance under motion tests, showing that the system can track tags at realistic warehouse speeds without any degradation in location performance."

    "abstract": "The development of wireless battery management systems (wBMS) for the next generation of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly gaining traction as a superior alternative to traditional wired BMS. Strain monitoring within lithium-ion battery cells is critical for assessing mechanical stress, which impacts state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). This paper presents a novel idea of battery-free, wireless strain sensing system based on ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID technology. The system features a flexible meander line inductor acting as RF strain gauge or sensing element (SE), integrated with a Magnus®S3 M3D RFID chip. The chip's self-tuning capabilities to dynamically adjust its impedance to maintain optimal antenna matching are utilized to design a passive (battery-free) RFID based wireless strain sensing system. The SE when integrated with an RFID Tag antenna, operates well in challenging metallic environments like metal-caged EV battery packs, offers an interesting solution for wireless passive measurement of battery cell inflammation (strain). By employing polynomial fitting a precise correlations of SE's capacitance/inductance with SE expansion/contraction is established in this paper. The proposed system addresses limitations of traditional strain sensors, such as high power consumption, complex wiring, and limited scalability while eliminating the need for a dedicated power source, this approach provides a sustainable and efficient wireless passive solution for next-generation automotive wBMS using UHF RFIDs."

    "abstract": "We benchmark H2O AutoML against individual H2O models such as Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, and Deep Learning for Android malware detection using the TUANDROMD dataset. From a signal-processing perspective, malware behaviors (e.g., API calls, broadcasts, and network events) are treated as discriminative signals subject to classification under strict training-time budgets (3–3600 s). Across precision, recall, F1, AUC, log loss, and accuracy, AutoML achieves the best calibrated performance (AUC ≈ 0.9998, log loss ≈ 0.0147 at 600 s) and the highest accuracy (up to 0.997), while DRF delivers the most stable results with the best accuracy-time-efficiency (near-peak accuracy in ∼5–6 s). Deep Learning exhibits lower time-efficiency due to slower convergence, requiring longer training durations (≥1000 s) to reach competitive performance and showing instability at shorter time budgets. By combining machine learning, pattern recognition, and explainable AI techniques in signal-processing, we demonstrate operational suitability for real-time security and forensics pipelines. These findings position AutoML as the best choice when probability calibration and peak accuracy are critical, while DRF is recommended for latency-constrained deployments. Notably, while Deep Learning achieved high accuracy, it remained less efficient under strict time budgets; tree ensembles offered the most favorable latency-accuracy trade-off."

Earlier methods often relied on approaches such as majority voting, averaging techniques, or leader election. In recent years, blockchain-based algorithms including Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and Raft have been adopted for this purpose. While these methods provide certain advantages, their application to swarm robotics is restricted by issues such as limited computational power, energy constraints, scalability challenges caused by message complexity and latency, and weak protection against Byzantine agents. This study introduces a consensus approach specifically designed to address these gaps and to improve collaborative decision-making in swarm environments. The work outlines the motivation for the proposed solution, describes the simulation-based experimental design, and presents a detailed analysis of the observed results."

Nevertheless, the complex systems inevitably become degradation due to operational conditions, environmental changes, and material aging. As a logical consequence, accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) in complex systems represents a fundamental component of effective maintenance strategies and asset management [5] . Accurate RUL prediction can help users plan maintenance resource allocation [6] . Furthermore, the unnecessary downtime and repair costs are decreased, thereby promoting production efficiency. The primary motivations for this research emerge from the following factors: • The degradation data of complex systems have strong temporal characteristics. Consequently, how to focus on key parts of the time window, and make full use of the temporal information requires further research [7] . • Conventional deep networks are usually regarded as black box model, the meaning of whose internal latent spaces is difficult to interpret. Furthermore, most of the RUL prediction approaches are point estimation, which requires in-depth work on uncertainty description [8] . • Conventional data-driven approaches demand massive labeled samples for supervised model training. How to effectively utilize unlabeled degradation data from a semi-supervised perspective requires further work [9] ."

This research focused on developing an image dataset to characterize microscopic debris in water samples collected from the Pasig River, Philippines, which can be used for water monitoring. The methodology involved collecting water samples from seven sampling sites, followed by physical processing and microscopic imaging. 1248 raw images were collected from the water samples. Preprocessing techniques, including noise reduction, pixel normalization, image resizing, contrast enhancement, and data enhancement, were applied to the images, where different noise reduction and contrast enhancement techniques and parameters were tested. K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models were employed to categorize the debris based on extracted features such as area, perimeter, circularity, color, and Hu Moments. The optimal preprocessing methods tested include the median filter with a kernel size of 3, CLAHE with a brightness of 120%. After preprocessing, the dataset had a total of 7488 images. Using RMSE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, and MSE, it was determined that K-Means clustering had demonstrated the best clustering performance on the debris dataset."

    "abstract": "Serverless cloud computing a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective execution model for modern applications, but it suffers significantly from the cold start problem—delays in function execution caused by the dynamic allocation of underlying resources. These delays have a critical impact on latency-sensitive applications, especially in fields such as healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things. The approaches used in cold session management are often fragmented, focusing only on isolated layers such as the application or infrastructure, and lacking intelligent coordination across the entire stack. To address these challenges, this article proposes an optimum holistic cold-start management framework (OHCSMF), which uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict function calls and optimize color harmony (CHO) to precisely adjust resource allocation strategies at various system levels. The ANN model predicts workloads for short periods (5-15 minutes), allowing for proactive decisions regarding pre-warming and cache reuse. At the same time, the CHO algorithm dynamically optimizes the configuration of the caching and preloading policy to reduce cold start time, while balancing memory usage and computational resources. Large-scale experiments using serverless logs show that the proposed OHCSMF reduces cold start latency by 43.6%, improves resource utilization by 37.8%, and outperforms leading techniques in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to changing loads. This AI-powered intelligent framework offers a robust and scalable solution to cold start challenges and paves the way for more interactive and flexible serverless systems."

    "abstract": "The condition monitoring of switch machines (SM), which are critical actuators in railway turnout systems, is essential for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of railways. However, traditional extended Kalman filters (EKF) face challenges in effectively capturing high-order nonlinear characteristics and accurately modeling the dynamic behaviors of short-term periodic systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a deep extended Kalman filter (DEKF) framework designed specifically for short-term periodic nonlinear systems. The proposed approach integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract intermediate features from the EKF, thereby enhancing the utilization of nonlinear dynamic information. Furthermore, a time-series sample set covering complete operation cycles is constructed to improve the representation of prior knowledge embedded in short-term periodic actions of the switch machine. By employing an offline training and online fusion strategy, the DEKF achieves high-precision real-time state estimation of the switch machine system. Simulation experiments conducted on a nonlinear switch machine model demonstrate that the proposed DEKF significantly outperforms the traditional EKF in state estimation accuracy, providing strong theoretical support for real-time condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of railway signaling systems."

The influence of process parameters, i.e., LIG morphology and transfer temperature, on the electrical performance of the transferred conductors is systematically investigated.

Indicatively: satellite and aerial imaging platforms are far more easily accessible today than it was five or ten years ago. It now permits us that the system should automatically obtain high-resolution imagery of large portions of the world. The quantity of data is so tremendous to a point it is difficult to manage and extract associated contents. The purpose of this work is to come up with the algorithms and techniques required to aid in the automation of the detection and tracking of objects of interest in such high-resolution images. Simply put, these images are processed by using a series of computational characteristics acquired by computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize the objects in them as living and divide according to their shape, size, and texture among others. It further employs parallel computing technology and real time data processing technology to process the data and produce results nearly instantly. Such a model can be of great use and of immense value in many situations like who to locate the destroyed infrastructure to assist disaster response personnel, identify suspicious activities to aid the police, and document the land cover to assist in environmental supervision. Such a technology has the potential to transform the way we handle aerial images to make applications and for use in time."

To address this issue, we propose a novel Spectral Space Transformation and Loss adjustment (SSTL) method. Specifically, SSTL introduces a frequency-domain rotation-and-self-mixing strategy that adaptively balances perturbations across high- and low-frequency components, thereby generating more transferable adversarial examples. Furthermore, to mitigate semantic degradation during reconstruction, we design a logits fine-tuning mechanism that up-weights the logits of true labels while suppressing others, effectively preserving the original semantic information and avoiding misleading gradient propagation. Various experimental results demonstrate that SSTL effectively improves adversarial transferability while significantly preserving the semantic information of each image."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a computationally efficient methodology for evaluating pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-induced alternating current (AC) copper losses in concentrated winding axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) machines. The proposed approach combines complex permeability modeling (CPM) with homogenization modeling (HM) of the coil region. The calculation algorithm consists of two sequential steps: AC copper loss evaluation under fundamental current and under PWM-induced harmonics. For the former, time-stepping finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to obtain the magnetic field and current density vectors within the coil domain, and the AC copper loss is calculated in the post-processing stage, similar to conventional iron loss evaluation. For the latter, time-harmonic FEA is employed to incorporate the complex permeability and account for high-frequency effects that cannot be captured in time domain post-processing. To validate the proposed method, two case studies using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models are conducted, as full PWM waveform application in a detailed 3D model is computationally infeasible. In addition, a complete machine-level validation under PWM excitation demonstrates good agreement with full FEA. The results confirm that PWM harmonics significantly increase both localized loss density and total AC copper losses by approximately 54% compared to the case neglecting PWM effects. These findings highlight the critical importance of incorporating PWM-induced harmonic effects in loss evaluations to avoid underestimating temperature rise and potential performance degradation in AFPM machines."

    "abstract": "Solid rocket motor (SRM) stands out as a pivotal aerospace propulsion system. In response to growing need for the intellectualization of launch vehicles and their propulsion modules, achieving real-time completion and prediction of key performance parameters, such as chamber pressure and thrust of SRM through online measurement data holds paramount importance in aerospace engineering. To overcome the limitations of traditional modeling methods and the scarcity of data, this paper introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that amalgamates mechanism modeling and residual learning. The deep neural network identifies key system parameters within low-fidelity mechanism model for internal ballistic simulation. Subsequently, the prediction results are generated based on a low-fidelity surrogate model. The introduction of a residual sequence as a model discrepancy function enhances the precision of prediction results. The study demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly improves prediction accuracy of SRM performance, with a 26.2% boost compared to data-driven methods and a 34.4% improvement over mechanism-driven methods in interpolation tests. Addressing the critical challenge of limited data in SRM engineering due to high costs, the proposed method exhibits a particularly pronounced enhancement effect on small samples, which achieves 30.2% improvement in a 64-sample dataset. This effectively strengthens the generalization of deep-learning-based prediction models, offering a practical pathway for intelligent SRM monitoring. Extrapolation tests further validate robust generalization of the model, showcasing an average improvement of 27.7% compared to pure data-driven models. This underscores the method's capability to deliver reliable prediction performance even when SRM parameters exhibit deviations. The hybrid deep learning framework, therefore, emerges as a promising approach for real time prediction of SRM performance in aerospace applications."

    "abstract": "Multi-UAV cooperative coverage missions across geographically separated regions face significant challenges due to potential UAV failures during mission execution. To address the challenges of efficient multi-region coverage and dynamic failure handling, this paper presents a novel real-time path-reconfigurable coverage-planning algorithm for multi-UAV coverage path planning across separated geographical areas with real-time path reconfiguration capabilities. The proposed approach, GRIT-M (Greedy Repair Initializes Tabu search for Multiple regions), extends the GRIT algorithm to efficiently handle both initial planning and online path repair when UAVs fail during mission execution. Unlike existing methods that either focus on single-region coverage or lack failure handling mechanisms, GRIT-M incorporates region-specific knowledge through three key innovations: (1) a composite transition cost function that optimizes inter-region movements, (2) a region-priority greedy repair mechanism that minimizes transition costs during replanning, and (3) a region-preserving Tabu search that maintains area coverage coherence while balancing workload. Extensive simulations demonstrate GRIT-M's scalability and robustness against operational constraints. The algorithm reduces inter-region flights by up to 27% compared to baselines and maintains excellent workload balance (CV <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt; $</tex-math></inline-formula> 7%). Crucially, it shows effective scalability with larger teams (up to 12 UAVs), maintaining a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&gt;$</tex-math></inline-formula> 91% replanning success rate with average repair times under 2.1 s. Its resilience to variations in battery capacity, sweep patterns, and initial UAV distributions confirms its suitability for time-critical aerial surveys over disjoint areas."

    "abstract": "The bipolar DC microgrid (BDCMG) has gained increasing relevance with the widespread adoption of DC sources and loads, primarily due to its higher efficiency, reliability, and flexibility. However, multiport DC–DC converters for interfacing multiple sources with BDCMG still face significant challenges, including voltage balancing, bidirectional power exchange capability, and source requirements. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a new four-port DC-DC converter for interfacing PV and battery to low-voltage BDCMG. The proposed converter allows fully independent bidirectional power flow among all four ports, enabling flexible power management between the BDCMG, PV, and battery. Owing to its completely independent output poles, the converter inherently compensates for voltage imbalance, even in the absence of PV generation. A robust control strategy is implemented to ensure stable and efficient operation over a wide range of conditions. The proposed design is verified through detailed simulation and experimental validation using a 2 × 600 W laboratory prototype. The main advantages of the proposed solution include: (a) inherent voltage balancing, (b) bidirectional power flow capability, (c) high performance and robust control across a wide operating range, (d) suitable voltage gain, low component stress, and minimal component count, (e) simple voltage and current control across all ports, (f) MPPT support, (g) battery charging control, and (h) continuous current interfaces for both the PV and battery ports."

So we propose a method to identify primary/secondary coil impedances and mutual impedance during system startup. Furthermore, a novel primary phase acquisition technique using a low-latency simultaneous power and data transmission channel is presented. This is essential because the phase difference between primary and secondary currents in UWPT systems, which deviates from 90 degrees at full resonance, is influenced by the mutual impedance. Furthermore, a double synchronous reference frame (DSRF) model of the UWPT system is established. By utilizing this model for power analysis in conjunction with the primary-side phase information, the proposed approach achieves effective parameter identification."

The case of Chhattisgarh has been alarming concerning groundwater depletion in the Kharun River Basin area, for proper evaluation of the spatiotemporal patterns and hydro-environmental aftereffects. This paper presents a approach for the geospatial visualization and data analysis of groundwater level changes in 143 observation wells of the Kharun Basin. This included data cleaning using the Python Pandas library, seasonal classification of water levels, and geospatial mapping via the Folium library. Correlation matrices which helped understand inter-feature relations by the deployment of supervised learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and classify groundwater level trends to understand which Model Performs Good. The trend analysis reveals a general decline in groundwater levels, with around 65% of the sites experiencing a considerable depletion rate. A maximum of 98.11% classification accuracy is by the Logistic Regression model. Feature importance analysis revealed that the pre-and post-monsoon water levels are as the top predictive features which we have used. Certain zones along surface water bodies indicate natural recharge. The decision-relevant recommendations for aquifer sustainability and city planning are supported by geospatial outputs and statistical results which can be used in this model. With open-source computational tools, the presented method is interpretable, scalable, and, above all, highly visual for studying groundwater depletion patterns. The method supports formulating some policy-relevant strategies to conserve groundwater resources, especially in semi-arid basins under hydro-environmental stress."

Our strategy is to train and compare four various architectures: (1) a basic convolutional neural network(CNN),(2) a sophisticated CNN constructed from scratch using the ResNet50V2 model architecture, (3) an adjustable CNN featuring four residual blocks for improved feature extraction, and (4) a Vision Transformer (ViT) model based on self-attention mechanisms to learn global contexts. All models undergo training with a 5-fold cross-validation protocol to provide rigorous and consistent comparison. Performance within folds is compared, providing a detailed analysis of the convolutional neural networks over transformer-based alternatives.

The chip's impedance varies between passive (no external power supply) and semi-passive (external supply) tags, so an appropriate antenna must be designed for each case to achieve optimum matching. Two tags, D1 and D2, were optimized as a passive and semi-passive tag, respectively. At an EIRP of 35 dBm (standard value), and acting as passive tags, the maximum read ranges were measured as 7.5 m and 5.5 m for tags D1 and D2, respectively. Acting as semipassive tags, they achieved remarkable read ranges with corresponding values of 25 m and 26 m. Both cases mainly agreed with theoretical calculations, where tag D1 outperforms tag D2 acting as a passive tag and the reverse happens acting as semi-passive tags. Finally, the performance of the custom tags was also compared with that of commercial tags."

The model learns to generate colour representations of grayscale images by estimating the chrominance components (a*, b*) from the luminance (L) channel in the CIELAB colour space. With its encoder–decoder structure with skip connections, our UNet model efficiently captures both low-level and high-level semantic features, allowing precise colour restoration while maintaining fine spatial details. A custom dataset of paired greyscale and coloured images is used to train the network, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function for optimisation. Quantitative evaluation metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, along with qualitative assessments, demonstrate that the model produces high-fidelity, visually pleasing results with minimal artefacts and colour bleeding. The experimental results validate the generalization capability of our model across diverse image domains. This work holds practical potential for digital media enhancement, restoration of old black-and-white photographs, and real-time image processing applications. In addition, We also evaluate our model against advanced colourization techniques, showing better structural coherence and overall generalization performance."

Under the impact of extreme weather conditions such as strong winds, it is prone to serious accidents such as metal fatigue, component damage, and even tower collapse and disconnection, posing a serious threat to the safety and stable transmission of electrical energy backbone structures. In this context, this article mainly systematically elaborates on the existing research results in three aspects: weak member identification, fatigue life prediction, and life extension reinforcement strategies. Existing research has shown that in the transmission tower cable system, weak areas are mainly distributed near the tower legs, cross arms, and main materials at the slope changes, which can be identified through stress ratio determination, refined finite element analysis, and dynamic failure simulation; The life prediction of members relies on multivariate fatigue analysis, wind-induced cumulative damage models, and a full probability evaluation framework; In terms of structural reinforcement, innovative methods such as buckling restrained angle steel reinforcement and bidirectional gas spring dampers are used to enhance the durability and wind resistance of transmission towers and lines. Intended to provide theoretical and key technical support for enhancing the precise life prediction maintenance and improving the structural resilience of transmission corridor projects, for future reference by relevant personnel in this field."

We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (≈91%) and area under ROC ⩾0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2 from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases reported by Çokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90 age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The model’s small size and strong performance (sensitivity >90%, specificity ≈90%), demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection."

However, their practical deployment faces significant challenges, primarily due to impedance mismatch and substantial ohmic losses stemming from strong mutual coupling required for supergain. This paper introduces a novel approach to address these challenges through the design of a single-feed, reactively-loaded five-dipole antenna array. By employing a global particle swarm optimization algorithm, the lengths and radii of the driven and parasitic elements, which are approximately half a wavelength long, along with four lumped reactive loads, are co-optimized in a full-wave method-of-moments electromagnetic model. The resulting impedance matched to 50Ω antenna array achieves steerable radiation across a complete 360-degree azimuthal scan at 3.5 GHz, with a realized gain between 8.5 and 10 dBi To the authors' knowledge, this work presents the first steerable superdirective antenna array achieving high radiation efficiency and impedance matching through combined optimization of reactive loads and physical element dimensions, providing a practical, low-complexity solution suitable for sub-6 GHz wireless communication applications."

    "abstract": "In the contemporary landscape, where patient lifting devices are often neglected, caregivers persist in dedicating considerable time to aiding patients with mobility. Although modern ceiling-mounted systems present sophisticated features, they may pose safety hazards and are limited in their range of movement. An automatic lifting device can reduce dependence on manual effort, bolster safety, and enhance user convenience. This study proposes a sliding mode controller (SMC) integrated with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for an automatic mobile patient lifting device, aimed at ensuring precise positional control and mitigating oscillatory vibrations during operation. The controller is formulated based on the Integral of Time-weighted Squared Error (ITSE) objective function, employing the PSO algorithm to determine optimal control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves positional accuracy and effectively dampens load oscillations. This approach holds substantial promise for real-world applications, particularly in healthcare environments where safety and user-friendliness are critical."

    "abstract": "Timely emergency medical response continues to be a significant problem, especially in the case of car crashes, where a delay can mean death. This article describes an AI-powered Real-Time Lifeline Framework using autonomous UAVs to expedite the provision of pre-hospital care. The framework aims to rapidly identify roadside crashes and to dispatch UAVs carrying valuable medical payloads. The framework consists of three parts: deep learning models (CNNs, RNNs) for identifying roadside incidents, adaptive Hybrid A*/D* algorithms for on-demand UAV navigation, and LTE/5G communication-based management system for EMS, police, and triage coordination. Performance assessments showed a 93.2% accuracy for identifying crashes, a 56.8% decrease in response time, and a 89.4% routing success rate compared to traditional practices. The results establish the framework's ability to improve response delay times and assist with triage support. Overall, the framework provides an impactful solution to emergency medical services by enabling pre-hospital care delivery within an urban traffic-congested location and in underserved rural settings; its positive implications for population health acceptability in urban traffic-congested areas, and potentially contribute to local smart city initiatives."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a behaviorally consistent and computationally efficient framework for optimal toll design in congested urban transportation networks. The toll-setting problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization model that captures the hierarchical interaction between a central planner and individual travelers. At the upper level, the planner aims to minimize Total System Travel Time (TSTT) by adjusting link-based tolls. At the lower level, user route choice behavior is modeled via a Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) using a logit-based formulation, which accounts for probabilistic decisions under bounded rationality. Due to the derivative-free, non-convex nature of the bilevel model, a hybrid solution approach is proposed by integrating a real-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the embedded SUE traffic assignment. The GA evolves toll vectors using TSTT as the fitness criterion, while the SUE module computes equilibrium link flows in response to toll adjustments. The proposed method is validated on a synthetic 6-node network with fixed origin-destination demand. Numerical experiments demonstrate a 5.02% reduction in TSTT compared to the no-toll baseline. The results reveal that strategic tolling on critical links redistributes traffic effectively, mitigating congestion and enhancing system efficiency. Flow visualizations further confirm user adaptation under the influence of tolls, validating the model’s behavioral realism. This research highlights the potential of metaheuristic–equilibrium hybrid models for dynamic pricing policy in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The framework is extensible to larger-scale networks, time-varying demand, and multi-objective planning, offering a robust foundation for future research and practical deployment."

    "abstract": "Bearing fault diagnosis is a critical task for ensuring the safe operation of industrial equipment. However, traditional methods suffer from low fault identification accuracy and computational inefficiency due to the time-varying characteristics of non-stationary vibration signals and the scarcity of fault samples in industrial scenarios. This paper proposes a method named \"CNN-LSTM with Complex Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Attention Mechanism (SEAM)\", which can achieve high-precision fault identification under small-sample conditions by extracting and deeply fusing spatiotemporal features of faults. First, this paper elaborates on the theoretical foundations underpinning the key components of the proposed method. Subsequently, experimental validation is performed using the bearing dataset from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). The results indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis method achieves 99.7% average diagnostic accuracy with limited training samples, while maintaining 99% accuracy even when the sample size is further halved. Finally, two critical conclusions are ultimately drawn."

RNA inherits the nonlinear fitting ability of NCA while taking advantage of the memory function of RNNs. As such, RNA simultaneously processes the nonlinear and dynamic characteristics in NCA framework. The results of a numerical simulation model showed that RNA can extract uncorrelated components from data with nonlinear and dynamic characteristics and that it performs better than traditional multivariate statistical process monitoring methods."

The current sales forecast methods based on historical data prove inadequate due to their inability to know about shifting trends and changing consumer choices in fashion market demand. The research limitation gets addressed through a deep learning algorithm that uses image-based feature extraction with machine learning methods. The system acquires vital visual characteristics from clothing image databases through the combined deployment of AlexNet and MobileNetV3 along with InceptionV3 deep learning networks. The analyst uses k-means clustering algorithms to analyze fashion purchase patterns after they extract data plus historical sales information. Future market outlook and fashion product preference evaluation depend on classification models based on decision trees. Experimentation with clothing products from a European-based fashion company with available sales data and picture information validates the model. Experimental tests have proven that the designed framework achieves more accurate forecasts as it develops essential insights to help fashion business owners execute data-centric decisions regarding product development and inventory management."

However, multi-agent systems face challenges in shared-target scenarios, where trajectory conflicts can cause congestion. This paper proposes a multi-line formation algorithm coordination to optimize the organization and flow of robots in narrow environments. The proposed approach combines flocking behavior with trajectory planning based on potential fields, introducing waiting sub-states to regulate access to the congestion area. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed limited-size multi-line coordination strategy effectively reduces both the distance traveled by robots and the duration of close encounters within congestion zones when compared to unlimited and limited-size multi-line motion. By introducing waiting sub-states and restricting line sizes, the method reduces swarm congestion during passage and demonstrates scalability, maintaining robust performance across different swarm sizes."

    "abstract": "Friction stir welding (FSW), an innovative solid-phase bonding technology, offers significant advantages in processing lightweight materials such as aluminum alloys. The health of its equipment is critical as it impacts welding process stability and product quality. Assessing the health state of the welding machine system is an effective means to improve welding quality. Existing methods are difficult to effectively use various types of information (expert knowledge, monitoring information, etc.) to establish a dynamic health state assessment model. The Belief Rule Base (BRB), an advanced method integrating quantitative and qualitative knowledge, is widely used in health state assessment of electromechanical equipment. This paper proposes a K-Means-BRB model for health state assessment of welding machine systems. The model employs BRB to establish the assessment framework by integrating monitoring information and expert knowledge. K-Means clustering optimizes the reference values of the premise attributes in the original BRB, while the projected covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy (P-CMA-ES) updates the BRB's initial parameters. Taking the FSW welding machine system for aluminum alloy battery casings as the research object, the model's feasibility is verified, providing a practical solution for health state assessment of welding machine systems."

This paper takes the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process as the object and builds a normal operating zone model for monitoring of Tennessee Eastman benchmark process. Firstly, based on the basic conservation laws such as material conservation and energy conservation, the mechanism models of each device in the TE process are constructed. Then, combined with the mechanism models and the control limits of some variables, the allowable variation ranges of monitoring variables under normal working conditions form a geometric space. The convex hull is used to depict the boundary of the geometric space, and the normal operating zone model of the TE process is obtained. Finally, a simulation case is designed using the TE process simulation model, which verifies that the established model can effectively monitor whether the TE process is in an abnormal state, providing a solid guarantee for the safe operation of the production process."

Traditional methods, such as expert peer review and citation-based metrics, often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency, highlighting the need for automated, scalable solutions. This study aims to address this gap by developing an end-to-end Natural Language Processing pipeline that leverages transformer-based models for novelty scoring of research ideas. The proposed framework integrates modules for literature collection, data organization, and semantic similarity analysis, using recent publications from the Web of Science database as a benchmark. Key findings indicate that the pipeline effectively differentiates between novel and less original ideas, with higher novelty scores corresponding to lower similarity with existing literature. This suggests that transformer-based embeddings can provide a robust and interpretable measure of research originality. The study contributes a replicable methodological approach that bridges literature retrieval with automated novelty scoring, offering practical value for academic and industrial innovation processes. The framework’s scalability and objectivity have significant implications for research institutions and funding bodies, enhancing the efficiency of idea screening and portfolio management."

To address these limitations, this study proposes and validates a deep learning framework for automated, real-time egg quality assessment and defect segmentation using the YOLOv5-seg model. A custom dataset comprising 660 images, categorized into four distinct quality classes (5-day, 15-day, cracked, and broken), was collected and annotated for this purpose. The framework’s performance was rigorously evaluated across five model variants, demonstrating exceptional results with optimal precision of 98.8%, recall of 97.7%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 97.3% for both detection and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between research and practical application, the trained model was successfully deployed into a mobile application featuring an intuitive interface for on-site image capture, defect visualization, and real-time classification. This work presents a robust, scalable, and highly accurate solution that significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of egg quality control, offering a pivotal technological advancement for the modern poultry industry."

    "abstract": "Free-space optical (FSO) communications have emerged as a high-capacity wireless technology for 6 G networks and last-mile connectivity. However, their performance is significantly affected by weather conditions and atmospheric turbulence, limiting both capacity and reliability. Optical amplification offers a promising approach to overcome the resultant power fluctuations. In particular, Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) operating in automatic power control (APC) mode can effectively compensate for signal fading by stabilizing the received power level prior to detection, thereby enhancing link reliability under dynamic channel conditions. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the adaptive optical power pre-compensation of atmospheric turbulence using two counter-propagating signals. A 400 Gbps upstream signal, affected by turbulence, is wavelength-multiplexed with a 10 Gbps downstream on-off keying (OOK) signal, and subsequently both signals are launched into an EDFA in APC mode. Leveraging the coherence time of atmospheric turbulence, we achieved joint upstream pre-compensation and downstream post-compensation of turbulence. The Rytov variance of both signals is analyzed under various turbulent conditions resorting to an atmospheric chamber, considering the different power ratios between both signals. The results reveal a reduction in the upstream Rytov variation of two orders of magnitude, effectively achieving turbulence suppression. Furthermore, real-time upstream signal analysis indicates reliability gains up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx 90\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>."

    "abstract": "The evolution beyond 5G and the advent of new 6G applications pose increasing challenges for communication in dense urban and hotspot areas. Photonics-assisted millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) communication systems have emerged as attractive solutions to meet these demands. Various enhancement schemes based on traditional digital signal processing (DSP) and neural networks have been proposed. However, the limitations of traditional DSP algorithms and the high complexity of supervised neural networks hinder real-time transmission. To address this issue, this article proposes an unsupervised DNN-based equalizer built upon the traditional constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for blind equalization of PAM signals, with structured pruning applied to facilitate practical deployment. Compared to the conventional CMA, the blind DNN equalizer effectively handles both linear and nonlinear impairments and achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance. Structured pruning reduces model floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 34%, successfully transforming the originally nondeployable architecture into a compact model executable in real-time on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), at the cost of a slight BER increase from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3.53\\times 10^{-3}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$6.84\\times 10^{-3}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>.

    "abstract": "Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. A number of memory-efficient training techniques have been explored in the MLSys community, including reversible networks and optimizer state quantization, which aim to reduce activation and optimizer memory usage. However, these general techniques have rarely been adapted or systematically analyzed for SV models operating on time–frequency representations. In this paper, we revisit these two classic directions and introduce a joint memory-efficient training strategy tailored for deep speaker embedding learning under resource-constrained conditions. Specifically, we (1) design two types of reversible architectures for SV, including a reshape-based reversible downsampling mechanism (Type II RevNets) to enhance the degree of reversibility across all layers, and (2) propose a dynamic, tree-based 8-bit quantization scheme for optimizer states that preserves numerical stability under heavy-tailed parameter distributions. The proposed joint reversible–quantized optimizer framework achieves up to 16.2x memory savings while maintaining nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the original systems. Extensive experiments on VoxCeleb show that our method enables training of deep ResNet and DF-ResNet models using only one or two consumer-grade GPUs, without sacrificing performance."

    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing is a foundational task in intelligent education, aiming to predict students’ future performance by modeling their historical interactions. Traditional knowledge tracing methods primarily focus on analyzing students’ learning behaviors, often neglecting their dynamically changing emotional states during the learning process. Given that emotion is an integral part of the cognitive process, neglecting emotional states will limit the representation capacity of knowledge tracing models for modeling students’ learning processes. To address this issue, we propose a novel emotion-aware knowledge tracing method to explore the impact of complex emotions (e.g., concentration, frustration, boredom, and confusion) on knowledge states throughout the learning process. Specifically, we design an emotion-aware fusion module to capture the joint influence of multiple coexisting emotional states on students’ answers during each exercise session. Additionally, we utilize graph convolutional networks to propagate embeddings and obtain the complete knowledge structure information of exercises. We further integrate exercise attributes and students’ emotional information through a feature fusion module, thereby incorporating emotional states into the knowledge tracing task. Finally, we apply a transformer-based knowledge evolution module to model students’ evolving knowledge states, achieving multiview fusion modeling of emotions, knowledge topology, and learning sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous knowledge tracing methods in predicting student performance."

The investigation considers variations in the number of series connected battery cells before being linked of the half-bridge. Based on these findings, three methods are explored to minimize loop inductance: (1) introducing magnetically coupled conductor/auxiliary loops to create a freewheeling path for the magnetization current, with parts of the auxiliary loop formed by sections of the power loop to achieve near-ideal coupling, (2) employing a solid copper shield as an alternative to auxiliary loops, and (3) optimizing the physical arrangement of the series connected battery cells. Experimental results show a reduction in loop inductance of up to 59% using the magnetically coupled auxiliary loop, and up to 66% with the solid copper shield."

To overcome the challenge of pilot shortage in UDWNs, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) technologies are employed, enabling users within the same cluster to share pilots efficiently. A closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency of conjugate beamforming receivers is derived, revealing that pilot contamination caused by pilot sharing severely degrades system performance. A novel hypergraph coloring (HGC)-based pilot assignment algorithm is proposed to address this issue, effectively capturing the complex cumulative interference among multiple users and D2D pairs. The algorithm constructs users' interference hypergraphs using a user-centric access point (AP) selection strategy and allocates pilots based on interference weights within these hyperedges. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves spectral efficiency, offering a promising solution for interference management in CF-mMIMO systems under UDWNs."

In recent years, many classical techniques in signal processing (SP) have been successfully extended to GSP. Among them, chirp signals play a crucial role in various SP applications. However, graph chirp signals, despite their potential importance, have not yet been formally defined. Here, we define graph chirp signals and establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for their analysis.We propose the graph fractional vertex–frequency energy distribution (GFED), which provides a powerful tool for processing and analyzing graph chirp signals.We introduce the general fractional graph distribution (GFGD), a generalized vertex–frequency distribution, along with the reduced-interference GFED that effectively suppress cross-term interference and enhance signal clarity. Furthermore, we develop a novel GFED domain filtering method for detecting graph chirp signals, enabling robust signal analysis in noisy environments. Moreover, this method demonstrates strong practical potential in real-world denoising tasks, achieving performance superior to several state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we explore the potential applications of graph chirp signals, highlighting their usefulness in denoising and compression."

    "abstract": "Configuration-related problems can seriously jeopardize the strength and security of big computing setups. The existing methods of fuzzing often fail to spot misconfigurations because they do not consider enough details and cannot produce adequate input. For this reason, this paper introduces ECFuzz++, a new fuzz testing tool that makes use of various types of AI to discover hidden and deep problems with configurations in advanced systems. The framework uses a multimodal analysis engine, a context-aware configuration extractor, a neural AI for generating mutations and also a system to prioritize flaws. It packs natural language processing, system log extracts, the content in the documentation and recordings of historical issues into profiles of system settings. This extractor locates and decodes the settings that link several software and hardware features together. Mutation generator uses transformers trained with real-world data to make new inputs that pass syntax checks and are still semantically different. The system ends with prioritization which uses graphs to determine the risks of each vulnerability by considering how easy it is to exploit and how significant its impact is. Good results have been achieved by running ECFuzz++ on both benchmark data and on actual enterprise configurations; it is better than other fuzzing frameworks when it comes to finding issues, how much it explores the programs and the relevance of the problems found. My findings show that the framework can greatly increase the strength of key systems using smart and scalable fuzzing of configurations."

IT2 T–S fuzzy gate is adopted to establish the fuzzy fault tree, which no longer needs the exact membership function. In the procedure of establishing T–S fuzzy rules, a novel weighted distance determination method is proposed to evaluate the occurrence probability of top events automatically. Particularly, experts only need evaluate the high and low failure rate of bottom events instead of exact value. In addition, the existing aggregation approach of expert views is not suitable to IT2 T–S FFTA, so this paper proposes a new aggregation method. Finally the proposed IT2 T–S FFTA is applied in an electro-optical tracking system (EOTS) and the failure rate of EOTS is obtained."

Thus, this paper proposes a novel structure for X-ray image authentication involving Histogram Segmentation, Fractional Fourier Transform (FRT) and Firefly Algorithm. The purpose behind this technique is to have enhanced image authentication accuracy with robustness by using these methods together. In other words, Histogram Segmentation provides the preprocessed X-ray images through dividing them into sections based on intensity levels thus allowing a better feature extraction. FRT converts these segmented images into a space that makes easy finding of several features, which are unique to each kind of picture and is secure from unauthorized use or access. Finally, the Firefly Algorithm is applied to optimize parameters of FRT so that it can find unauthorized changes in X-ray pictures more effectively. The experimental outcomes indicate that this proposed framework has good performance as far as authentication precision, computational efficiency and resilience against typical image attacks are concerned. On this account; this framework stands significant advancement in protecting medical images in a secure manner thus guaranteeing that the data regarding patients within health care units is intact and confidential."

For knowledge-driven fault knowledge graphs, the Graph Attention Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GADDPG) is utilized to achieve precise fault path inference.

This paper compares feature-based, raw data-based, and model-based clustering methods to identify the most effective approach for extracting meaningful patterns. We evaluate these methods using Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. Results show that model-based methods, especially Gaussian Mixture Models, outperform others in cluster compactness and separation, despite some negative Silhouette scores. Feature-based methods provide moderate stability, while raw data-based approaches yield mixed results. Limitations include zone-level data without inter-zone links, absence of benchmark datasets with labels, and a limited range of tested algorithms. Future work will address these by expanding data scope, incorporating benchmarks, and exploring more clustering techniques.

AutoEncoders, as a deep learning technique, has been widely adopted for dimensionality reduction of the data and also preserving significant features of the data. The dataset used for dimensionality reduction is MNIST, to compare the various types of autoencoders. All AEs have a compression ratio of 91.84% and they are compared using four evaluation metrics, the first two are statistical metrics and the next two are visualization metrics; Mean Squared Error(MSE), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Structural Similarity Index(SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) respectively. Contractive AE shows superior performance by giving highest scores for the visual metrics, SSIM (0.8959), and PSNR (24.00), which are of most importance in dimensionality reduction of images. A complexity analysis is then carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency of the various autoencoders in terms of its time complexity and space complexities respectively. Additionally, Contractive AE has a tradeoff between performance and time and space complexities. Finally, this paper is concluded giving insights for future research direction."

Accurately predicting their remaining useful life (RUL) is vital for maintaining operational safety and economic efficiency. Nevertheless, gathering adequate, high-quality, whole-life-cycle data under real-world operating conditions presents difficulties, resulting in a \"small sample\" challenge for prediction methods based on deep learning. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces a meta-learning framework that utilizes an enhanced Relation Network (RN). An embedding module combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer (CNN-Transformer) is crafted to effectively capture both local and global temporal features. The relation module is used to assess the similarity between the operating condition and the initial state of lithium-ion batteries, facilitating the construction of health state representations and enabling RUL predictions. Comparative experiments conducted on publicly available NASA and eVTOL datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves impressive accuracy and robustness, even when data availability is limited. This research provides new perspectives on predicting the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries in scenarios with small sample sizes."

    "abstract": "Material adhesion on rotor surfaces in supergravity reactors induces creates uneven mass distribution, leading to imbalance vibrations that degrade bearings and seals, ultimately resulting in hazardous leakage. While conventional rotor dynamics provides temporary mechanical equilibrium, it fails to resolve persistent imbalance caused by material adhesion. To address this limitation, this study proposes an innovative electromagnetic levitation spherical rotor system that combines structural redesign with adaptive control. This system fundamentally departs from traditional cylindrical configurations by eliminating the motor, shaft, and bearings. Instead, the rotor is reconfigured as a hollow sphere filled with packing material and embedded with surface magnetic poles. Dual coil arrays generate contactless levitation forces and multidirectional torque, enabling three-degree-of-freedom rotation about the sphere's geometric center. When material adhesion disrupts mass symmetry, a PID control algorithm dynamically adjusts the currents in both suspension and rotation coils. This active control mechanism simultaneously repositions the rotor's center of mass to align with its rotational axis and cancels the unbalanced mass radius, thereby continuously neutralizing centrifugal forces. By maintaining zero effective eccentricity despite ongoing material accumulation, the system eliminates imbalance vibration at its source.This approach effectively solves the persistent leakage problem in conventional supergravity reactors while significantly improving operational stability and service life."

Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of our analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed RIS-RSMA-UAV system significantly outperforms a baseline RSMA-UAV system without RIS, nearly doubling the EC in the low transmit power regime, while the gain diminishes at high transmit powers, suggesting that simpler configurations may suffice when power is abundant. Based on these insights, we propose design guidelines for RIS sizing and UAV altitude selection under varying power constraints."

    "abstract": "In complex urban propagation environments, communication coverage and quality are often degraded due to multipath fading and shadowing. Conventional fixed relay stations cannot flexibly adapt to these dynamic conditions. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic network construction method that employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relay nodes. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in the autonomous flight path control of UAVs, which leverages their mobility to dynamically navigate toward locations with superior communication quality, defined here as received power above -68 dBm. In the proposed method, the UAV sequentially estimates the distribution of signal arrival directions during flight using the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, and is guided toward directions expected to provide higher received power. For performance evaluation, we conducted ray-tracing simulations that consider urban propagation characteristics. The results show that the proposed method improves the average received power by approximately 6.6 dB compared to simple straight-line flight, demonstrating the effectiveness of UAV mobility and flight path control for aerial network optimization."

This paper presents a dual-modal wasserstein generative adversarial networks-variational autoencoder (WGAN-VAE) based on generative-reconstructive co-optimization. By decoupling stationary and non-stationary components, it aims to enhance fault detection accuracy. WGAN erforms cross-generation on data to separate stationary and non-stationary parts and strengthens the feature representation. WGAN’s adversarial training between generator and discriminator produces high-quality samples of both types, offering richer features. VAE is then adopted to reconstruct and extract features from the generated data. The dual-modal WGAN-VAE is optimized using KL divergence and reconstruction errors, capturing global data features and enhancing robustness through latent-space regularization. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and robustness in fault detection, particularly in handling non-stationary data."

Feature vectors constructed from four characteristic parameters (peak, waveform, margin, and kurtosis indices) serve as inputs to a SOM neural network for clustering-based classification. Simulation experiments conducted on six operating states using 54 datasets (36 for training, 18 for testing) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The SOM network achieves full cluster separation after 1,000 training iterations, and testing yields a fault identification accuracy of 94.44%, validating the method's robustness and diagnostic precision across multiple failure modes in artillery automatic mechanisms."

This paper presents a system design and optimization framework that supports secure transmission and operates under practical constraints. The proposed model is based on a transmission structure divided into three time slots, where a base station interacts with two users, two energy-harvesting relays, two friendly jammers, and two eavesdroppers. The backscattering mechanism implemented by the users symbiotically reinforces both legitimate transmission and feeds the energy harvesting of the relays. The goal is to maximize energy efficiency without violating privacy requirements. To achieve this, time margins and reflection coefficients are jointly optimized, observing realistic constraints such as quality of service and power thresholds. Numerical results reveal consistent gains across different channel and noise levels, a low-to-moderate range for jammer power, adaptation of reflection and time margins according to thresholds, and a security-energy tradeoff that increases but approaches saturation. The findings provide feasible tuning recommendations for safe and energy efficient cellular system design."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the growing use of mobile terminals, such as smartphones and IoT devices, has drastically increased communication demands. To accommodate, this ever-increasing demand, cell-free systems have emerged as a promising solution, significantly contributing to the two requirements of 6th generation (6G): \" ultra-high-speed, ultra-large-capacity communications \" and \"reliable communications\". The cell-free environment is attracting attention in 6G communication systems because it enables optimal antenna placement according to inter-cell interference and demand, which are problems in a cellular environment. However, in practical systems, communication performance can be degraded by In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) imbalance caused by imperfections in analog hardware. This paper presents an approach for alleviating IQ imbalance in cell-free networks by adaptively selecting a transmitter based on received signal strength. The phase shift caused by IQ imbalance is corrected by estimated adaptively using time frequency interferometry-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TFI-OFDM) to achieve more accurate channel compensation. Simulation results confirm that the method improves bit error rate (BER) performance."

The algorithm dynamically fuses the classical water-filling approach with sensing-aware power profiles to ensure compliance with both communication and sensing objectives, while keeping the resulting capacity loss within an acceptable bound. Simulation results reveal that JSCO-DA consistently outperforms conventional dynamic allocation techniques by delivering enhanced capacity, energy efficiency, and spectral efficiency under joint PSL–CRB constraints.

Accurate detection of the locomotive sanding device is critical for monitoring its sanding state. Aiming at the challenges of model redundancy and insufficient feature extraction in existing detection methods under resource-constrained scenarios, this paper proposes an improved RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer)-based detection method for locomotive sanding devices. The method replaces the original ResNet-18 with MobileNetV4 as the backbone network, significantly reducing model parameters while maintaining performance. Additionally, a Local Feature Extraction (LFE) module is introduced to optimize the RepC3 (Reparameterized Convolution Block 3), enhancing the network’s representational capability for fine-grained features of the sanding device. Through comprehensive experimental validation, the optimized RT-DETR framework demonstrates a 1.9% enhancement in mean average precision (mAP), together with a 43.7% reduction in parameter quantity and a 32.3% decline in computational demand (GFLOPs). These improvements collectively establish a robust, industrial-level approach for intelligent operation and maintenance within rail transit applications."

Learning from such a high-profile failure means that we bring forth the ECLIPSE Economic Model, a Cryptoeconomic architecture that seeks to incentivize stakeholders, spread risks and make cybersecurity ecosystems more resilient. ECLIPSE uses decentralized technologies, token-based participation, and federated threat intelligence to solve the classic adoption paradox: solutions that are technically feasible are often the wrong economic or operational fit.

    "abstract": "The advent of Industry 5.0 has resulted in a seamless merger of human creativity with machine intelligence, propelling new levels of automation and innovation. Within this paradigm, the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) are critical technologies that enable smart and adaptable industrial processes. However, increased connectivity and data interchange across IoT devices expose Industry 5.0 systems to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, including data breaches and adversarial assaults on ML models. This study presents a strong security framework designed for IoT-driven, machine learning-enabled settings in Industry 5.0. The protocol uses sophisticated encryption technologies, blockchain-based data integrity verification, and federated learning approaches to improve data privacy and system resilience. Furthermore, it uses anomaly detection methods to detect and mitigate real-time threats. A thorough study of the proposed protocol proves its capacity to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while being computationally efficient. This study is an important step toward creating safe and trustworthy Industry 5.0 ecosystems."

Recent studies have highlighted correlations in multi-source data through centralized interaction to facilitate data fusion. However, the centralized strategy heavily relies on the quality of global representation. Motivated by the need for efficient high-quality global representation, we propose an information bottleneck-enhanced global representation with split centralized interaction (IGSC). First, we develop an information bottleneck-enhanced variational approximation to achieve a compressed and preserved global representation. Second, we split the multi-source data to individually interact with the global representation. Finally, we verify the proposed fault diagnosis method using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault dataset. The experimental results of IGSC demonstrate improvements in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability."

Model performance was rigorously assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. Among the models evaluated, the Boosted Decision Tree achieved the most balanced performance with an accuracy of 0.774, recall of 0.663, and F1 score of 0.671. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks demonstrated higher precision but lower recall, underscoring important trade-offs for clinical application. This study highlights the practical potential of low-code machine learning platforms in accelerating healthcare analytics. However, limitations include the specific demographic of the Pima dataset, lack of model interpretability methods, and no assessment of fairness. Future research will focus on model generalizability, integration of explainable AI techniques, and fairness evaluation.

However, in complex and dynamic environments, such systems are inevitably susceptible to disruptions, necessitating formation reconfiguration to restore performance and ensure mission continuity. In this brief, we propose a resilience-oriented optimization framework for multi-UAVs formation reconfiguration, providing a comprehensive solution through the design of a resilience metric and a customized algorithm. Specifically, the novel resilience metric tailored for multi-UAV formation reconfiguration integrates key aspects of time efficiency, topological reconfiguration accuracy, and operational availability. Building on this, we enhance the sheep flock migration optimization (SFMO) by introducing an adaptive parameter updating mechanism, enabling the algorithm to computationally optimize the resilience metric and derive the optimal recovery solution. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

    "abstract": "The android robot Andrea was set up at a public museum in Germany for six consecutive days to have conversations with visitors, fully autonomously. No specific context was given, so visitors could state their opinions regarding possible use-cases in structured interviews, without any bias. Additionally the 44 interviewees were asked for their general opinions of the robot, their reasons (not) to interact with it and necessary improvements for future use. The android’s voice and wig were changed between different days of operation to give varying cues regarding its gender. This did not have a significant impact on the positive overall perception of the robot. Most visitors want the robot to provide information about exhibits in the future, while opinions on other roles, like a receptionist, were both wanted and explicitly not wanted by different visitors. Speaking more languages (than only English) and faster response times were the improvements most desired. These findings from the interviews are in line with an analysis of the system logs, which revealed, that after chitchat and personal questions, most of the 4436 collected requests asked for information related to the museum and to converse in a different language. The valuable insights gained from these real-world interactions are now used to improve the system to become a useful real-world application."

Unlike conventional designs based on finite state machines (FSM), the proposed pipeline structure significantly improves throughput performance by processing data continuously across multiple stages. The decoder utilizes the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to efficiently determine the error locator polynomial and employs Chien’s Search method to accurately identify error positions. The entire system is implemented and verified on an Altera Cyclone V FPGA device (5CEFA2F23C8). Simulation results and on-hardware execution demonstrate that the pipelined approach achieves considerably higher throughput compared to traditional FSM-based designs while maintaining decoding accuracy. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for high-speed communication applications."

The findings reveal a consistent under-representation of women in most occupations, with models pre-dominantly depicting male-presenting individuals in traditionally male or gender neutral roles, while female-presenting figures appear mainly in female dominated occupations. This pattern reflects and potentially amplifies existing biases permeating throughout the society, raising concerns about the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes through AI-generated media. The paper highlights the need for culturally aware AI development and ongoing bias auditing to foster fairer and more inclusive representations in generative AI system, especially within the Indian context."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of chemical engineering data, such as nonlinear distribution, diverse categories, large scale, and difficult-to-distinguish fault characteristics, this paper proposes an combination fault diagnosis model of the improved student psychology based optimization algorithm - autoencoder - bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ISPBO-AE-BiGRU) to improve the accuracy and reliability of the fault diagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Firstly, the AE is used to extract the features of the TE process data, which effectively reduces the data dimension and retains the key feature information. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit has the ability to capture sequence data bidirectionally, and it can better handle the time series characteristics in the chemical process data, thus improving the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In order to further optimize the parameters of the AE-BiGRU model, the student psychology based optimization algorithm is introduced. The Tent mapping and Cauchy mutation strategies are used for improvement, and then the optimal solution is quickly searched in the search space to obtain the optimal parameter combination and improve the performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with other single fault diagnosis methods and combined fault diagnosis methods, the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of fault recognition accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 value, and it can accurately and quickly diagnose a variety of fault types."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral unmixing aims to decompose the mixed pixels into pure spectra and calculate their corresponding fractional abundances. It holds a critical position in hyperspectral image processing. Traditional model-based unmixing methods use convex optimization to iteratively solve the unmixing problem with hand-crafted regularizers. While their performance is limited by these manually designed constraints, which may not fully capture the structural information of the data. Recently, deep learning-based unmixing methods have shown remarkable capability for this task. However, they have limited generalizability and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperspectral unmixing method regularized by a diffusion model (URDM) to overcome these shortcomings. Our method leverages the advantages of both conventional optimization algorithms and deep generative models. Specifically, we formulate the unmixing objective function from a variational perspective and integrate it into a diffusion sampling process to introduce generative priors from a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Since the original objective function is challenging to optimize, we introduce a splitting-based strategy to decouple it into simpler subproblems. Extensive experiment results conducted on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our proposed method."

    "abstract": "Channel estimation in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems presents substantial challenges, especially under low pilot overhead. This paper proposes a novel tensor-based hybrid-field (TBHF) channel estimation scheme for XL-MIMO. We first develop a unified hybrid-field tensor decomposition framework that models received signals as a third-order low-rank tensor, from which channel parameters, including angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), distance, time delay, and path gain, are jointly estimated via factor matrices. To distinguish far-field and near-field components, we propose a path classification mechanism that does not require prior knowledge of path component proportions. For near-field estimation, we introduce an angle-adaptive distance grid design and a two-step estimation strategy, enhancing accuracy and reducing complexity. We analyze the uniqueness of the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition, demonstrating the potential of TBHF to substantially reduce training overhead. The Cramér-Rao Bound for hybrid-field parameter estimation is derived, and simulations verify that TBHF outperforms existing methods in normalized mean square error."

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) seeks to correlate unseen hand-drawn sketches with unseen real images by leveraging trained models on visible categories. Recent CLIP-based models, which primarily focus on visual-textual interaction, have demonstrated strong competitiveness in ZS-SBIR. However, they still fall short in the exploration of cross-modal visual representations, especially in terms of cross-modal visual shared and specific information. Differing from the aforementioned researches, we start with class-level, prompt-level, and patch-level visual information, committed to unlocking the potential of visual feature representation. On this foundation, we introduce the vision-centric Triple-way visual modulATion (TAT) framework to enhance the model’s perception of visual shared and specific information. Specifically, we establish unified multi-modal perception by integrating visual-level modality prompter into the CLIP architecture. We then conduct triple-way modulation modeling on prompt, token, and patch levels to effectively mine shared and specific features. Lastly, we develop an enhanced calibration strategy incorporating prompt-aware, token-aware, and logit-aware alignment modules to amplify the model’s proficiency in probing shared-specific features. We thoroughly test our approach to confirm its excellence and the efficacy of individual components. The comparison results on the popular datasets Sketchy, Sketchyv2, Tuberlin, and QuickDraw show that the developed algorithm significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art technologies."

    "abstract": "This work presents a machine learning-enhanced ultrasonic sensing framework for real-time glycerol concentration monitoring in direct fuel cell environments. Glycerol is a promising biofuel due to its high hydrogen content, low toxicity, and waste-to-energy potential. Accurate concentration tracking is essential to optimize oxidation pathways, maximize faradaic efficiency, and extend catalyst longevity. A custom piezoelectric array operating at 5 kHz and 40 kHz, under excitation voltages of 3.3, 5, and 9 V, was used to measure acoustic attenuation in aqueous glycerol solutions. The attenuation response exhibited sigmoidal behavior with R² > 0.99 and sensitivity peaks aligned with electrochemically relevant ranges. Model robustness was assessed via non-parametric bootstrap resampling. To enable predictive generalization, synthetic data were generated using interpolation and noise injection, supporting the training of polynomial, support vector, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression models. The MLP achieved superior accuracy with the lowest RMSE and highest R² under 30×5 Monte Carlo cross-validation. Sensitivity analysis identified acoustic features at 5 kHz/5 V and 5 kHz/9 V as dominant predictors, consistent with viscous media propagation theory. The proposed approach offers a low-cost, non-invasive, and embedded solution for in situ glycerol sensing, supporting intelligent diagnostics and enhanced energy conversion efficiency in renewable fuel cell systems."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatio-temporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model based on CILP</i> (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multi-aspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatio-temporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into vision-language models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imaging, yet small-scale, densely clustered ships remain difficult to detect because coherent speckle noise and coastal clutter often mask target echoes. Current detectors, derived mainly from optical imaging methods, fail to extract weak signatures from minute vessels and to separate closely spaced targets from background clutter, leading to frequent missed detections and elevated false-alarm rates. This paper presents SAR-D-FINE, a context-aware detection framework tailored for SAR imagery. Extending the D-FINE architecture, we design a hybrid backbone with a StarStage module that strengthens nonlinear feature extraction under heavy noise. A Focusing Diffusion Encoder, integrating a Multi-Kernel Aggregation Module (MKAM) and a parameter-free Shuffle-and-Shift Upsampling (SSU) unit, is adopted to aggregate multi-scale features without sacrificing fine spatial details. Experimental results on SSDD and HRSID indicate that SAR-D-FINE surpasses existing methods, including dedicated SAR detectors such as YOLO-SARSI and SW-Net, achieving AP improvements of 2.0% and 1.8% over the baseline, respectively. The results confirm the advantages of the proposed model, particularly for detecting small, densely distributed vessels."

However, HEDSM suffers from serious vibration because of the doubly salient poles structure. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the electromagnetic force and vibration characteristics of HEDSM is presented. Firstly, the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the radial electromagnetic force acting on the stator tooth surface are derived analytically and validated using two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT-2D). Furthermore, a comparison is made between the natural frequency and modal shape of the single stator core and the composite stator core which contains windings and permanent magnets (PMs). A multiphysics model is established to calculate the vibration of the HEDSM. Through the mode superposition method, the vibration acceleration on the motor surface under the rated operating conditions is computed. Finally, an 18/11 pole HEDSM prototype is fabricated. Experimental measurements of the natural frequency of the assembled stator core and the vibration acceleration are conducted, demonstrating good agreement with the theoretical analysis and simulation results."

The protection configuration for the conventional power transformer in IEEE Std C37.91-2021 and the countryspecific grid codes are no longer relevant to the SST because of its diverse topologies and functionalities. Furthermore, most of the protection configuration for the SST is designed considering its standalone operation. In this context, this paper proposes a protection system for the SST for its operation in a substation within a power grid, rather than focusing solely on its protection for the standalone operation. The potential faults and their recommended protection functions have been proposed compared with the existing protection setup utilized for the conventional power transformer (CPT). Additionally, the paper details the differential currents required to activate the differential protection for internal faults for different operating modes of the SST. The proposed protection scheme incorporates several protection features aimed at holistic protection of the SST, and its effectiveness has been validated at the system level by employing an IEEE-13 node test feeder."

The use of UAVs, particularly quadrotors equipped with onboard cameras for tasks such as aerial filming, reconnaissance, and search and rescue (SAR) has received growing attention due to their flexibility and superior maneuverability compared to other UAV platforms. With the advancement of AI-powered object tracking algorithms, real-time visual data constitutes a highly promising contribution to quadrotor control systems. Motivated by these trends, this study proposes a lightweight tracking algorithm that is specifically designed for efficient deployment on embedded hardware platforms. The proposed algorithm not only offers a low computational footprint but also improves performance and accuracy in real-time object tracking tasks. In addition, a quadrotor control system capable of following a target in GNSS-denied environments is developed. To validate the effectiveness and deployability of the proposed system, a Software in the Loop (SITL) simulation is conducted, and a Hardware in the Loop (HITL) simulation framework is developed for the Raspberry Pi 5 platform using the PyBullet simulation environment."

    "abstract": "Increases in market turbulence, a broad spectrum of customer requirements, and the dynamics of highly saturated markets pose significant challenges to production systems and their production planning and control (PPC). Alongside the necessity to accommodate an expanded range of products, these systems are required to facilitate elevated throughputs and offer a substantial degree of adaptability against process fluctuations and unanticipated occurrences. To address these challenges, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for optimizing PPC. In contradistinction to alternative machine learning methodologies, RL engages in direct interaction with its environment, thereby facilitating real-time responses to system alterations and direct interventions in the PPC. The primary focus of this work is the implementation of an RL agent with a specific emphasis on production control and a comprehensive examination of the sequencing process at individual workstations. For the purpose of this study, an RL agent was employed, which uses Q-learning as a widely used RL algorithm, to automate the task of sequencing as a central PPC task. From a production logistics perspective, the agent integrates the schedule-oriented and setup time-oriented perspectives in its decision-making processes. The implementation of the RL agent is embedded within the process chain of the IFA Learning Factory. The findings indicate that the RL agent can reliably automate the task of sequencing following a learning process that is clearly discernible. Concurrently, the RL agent is capable of establishing a balanced prioritization between a solely setup-time-oriented and a solely schedule-oriented perspective, while concurrently pursuing both perspectives."

    "abstract": "Compressive Sensing (CS) has emerged as a new paradigm in signal processing for efficient sampling and reconstruction of signals. In magnetostatic applications, reconstructing vector magnetic fields from limited measurements is important for modeling various engineering phenomena yet remains challenging under undersampling conditions. This study presents modeling and simulation of CS applied to a static magnetic field scenario involving the presence of ferromagnetic object. By sparsely and randomly sampling the magnetic field data in both the x and y directional components, the complete magnetic field distribution across the entire area can be succesfully reconstructed. Visual inspection and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) analysis generally show that the Total Variation (TV) method outperforms Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), producing smoother magnetic field images in homogeneous regions, while TV tends to be less accurate in areas with sharp field variations. Conversely, based on 20 trials for each tested sampling ratio, the standard deviation analysis indicates that OMP tends to produce more consistent results than TV, especially when the sampling rate exceeds 40%. This work presents a comparative study of OMP and TV in reconstructing vector magnetostatic fields from undersampled data – a scenario less explored in existing compressive sensing literature – indicating that OMP and TV each have strengths in certain aspects of vector magnetostatic field reconstruction under CS frameworks."

Monitoring data often exhibit fragmented characteristics due to sensor failures and data communication packet loss. This paper proposes a federated cycle-consistent latent attention method for missing feature generation (Fed-CCLA), which reconstructs missing features by sharing degradation information across clients within a federated learning framework. The missing feature generation is optimized by matching features with similar degradation levels between clients using cycle-consistent feature alignment. At the same time, a latent attention mechanism dynamically assigns larger weights to the most relevant features and ensures consistency of the complementary features in terms of degradation trend, stage evolution, and feature distribution, thereby improving the accuracy of missing feature generation from fragmented data. Experimental results demonstrate that Fed-CCLA effectively reconstructs missing degradation features under various scenarios involving fragmented data."

Lite-RVFL introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is derived.

The main use of the different supervised machine learning algorithms in this research paper is to predict the wine quality based on the physical and the chemical properties. Red and white wine samples with characteristics like pH, alcohol content, acidity, and Sulphur dioxide levels were used in the datasets. Based on the different characteristics of wine and the different performance parameter metrics like accurateness, exactness, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used for training and testing different machine learning (ML) models like Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting. During the machine learning models' training and assessment, cross-validation techniques were used to guarantee model generalization and avoid overfitting. As per the feature importance examination, volatile acidity and alcohol content were two of the most important variables influencing wine quality. This research shows the outputs obtained from the ML models can improve quality control procedures in the wine business and provide a data-driven method to assist with wine production and classification plans."

This has escalated the risk of citizens' rights being violated in cyberspace. Moreover, Ukraine's priority focus on digital transformation, while vital to its development, presents new challenges in cyber security. The introduction of emerging technologies, digital services, and systems for citizen-state interaction, including the electoral process, has created a web of hidden technological and procedural interdependencies.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) offers seamless communication among connected devices. Routing Protocol for Low power Lossy Networks is popular standard yet in some cases it also experiences high energy consumption, inefficient link metric selection and congestion which leads to shorter lifespan of the network. The current works focus on static objective functions and static link metrics which do not adjust according to the changing network conditions. We aim to solve these issues by a regression based model for optimal MAX_LINK_METRIC selection for RPL which maximises the energy efficiency and routing effectiveness. We created an equation that automatically adjusts the MAX_LINK_METRIC based on the number of nodes present in the network. The recommended method is developed after running multiple simulations in the Cooja simulator and evaluating important performance metrics like power consumption, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Expected Transmission Count (ETX) and hop count. Our study shows that the proposed model reduces energy consumption making the network more stable and reliable. Compared to traditional RPL implementations our approach is more scalable and ensures better efficiency and a longer network lifespan."

    "abstract": "Cleft lip abnormalities can cause a serious oral health issue if it is not treated properly in a timely manner. Having a child with a cleft lip can be financially straining, as the child will require extra care since the cleft will not only affect their feeding and speech development but also face aesthetics and overall psychological health. However, general hospitals especially in rural areas lack dependable medical resources, which makes the diagnosis of the cleft subjective and inconsistent between medical professionals. This study aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is able to classify types of cleft lip among children. A total of 1976 cleft lip images, collected from various internet websites was utilized in this study. Transfer learning was used to assess the CNN’s models, namely AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-50. Classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) was embedded in the CNN to optimize the results. With an accuracy of 94.06%, ResNet-50 with SVM classifier performed the best in classifying the type of cleft lip among children. Based on this result, it shows that the CNN with classifier is able to accurately classify cleft lips classes. Furthermore, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed based one CNN-classifier model which help clinicians classifying type of cleft lip in real time mode. Hence, this study demonstrates how deep learning potentially be used to improve medical diagnosis, even in environments with limited resources."

In particular, an SMLO is designed, which not only overcomes the problems of chattering, but also improves estimation accuracy and dynamic response speed. Firstly, employing small-perturbation theory, a mathematical model for the aircraft system is constructed and linearized. Subsequently, an SMLO performs concurrent estimation of unmeasurable system states and faults, and dynamic gain adjustment is performed using historical data. Then, a state feedback fault-tolerant (SFFT) controller is synthesized using these estimations to ensure system safety and tracking accuracy, with its asymptotic stability rigorously demonstrated via Lyapunov theory. Finally, an example of the Lockheed F-104 fighter aircraft model is provided to verify that the control strategy can accurately estimate faults."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised clustering plays a vital role in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis by enabling the automatic grouping of heartbeats based on morphological similarity, without the need for large, annotated datasets. This is particularly important for long-term ECG monitoring, where manual labeling is infeasible and adaptability to signal variation is essential. However, implementing such algorithms on wearable or ambulatory devices remains challenging due to strict constraints on power, latency, and hardware resources. To address these limitations, we propose a real-time, resource-efficient clustering engine based on a dynamic template-matching algorithm. The method integrates Pearson waveform similarity with RR-interval timing to adaptively update templates and detect outlier beats as potential arrhythmias. The algorithm is mapped to a parallel FPGA architecture, featuring pipelined processing elements, a template-management unit, and high-bandwidth on-chip memory to meet real-time performance demands. We implement the design on an Xilinx Kria KV260 FPGA platform operating at 166MHz. The system classifies every beat in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database in real time, achieving 95.52% overall accuracy and per-class sensitivities of 100% for normal beats, 99.64% for ventricular premature beats, and 99.91% for atrial premature beats. The resulting IP core offers a compact and reusable hardware solution suitable for energy-efficient, patient-adaptive ECG monitoring in next-generation wearable healthcare systems."

    "abstract": "Mobile apps running on smartphones have remained in the researchers’ spotlight since their inception in 2007. Google Android has only progressed over the years and Google has kept it up to date by releasing new and powerful components. With millions of apps available on online platforms such as Google Play, the quality of these apps has always been a concern for users and developers. Therefore, mobile app developers aim to produce high-quality and bug-free apps. The detection and removal of software bugs pose one of the most significant challenges for developers, consuming considerable time and effort during the traditional testing process. Researchers have explored different techniques to help developers discover software bugs in the early stages of the project. One of the most successful and popular techniques is the machine learning (ML) approach, where the dataset plays a crucial role in any bug prediction model. The researchers have explored different ways to build bug datasets that can serve as input for these ML models.In this research, we constructed a public Android bug dataset by utilizing various open-source Android apps from GitHub platform, using commit numbers to identify buggy classes. In contrast to the previous datasets, which utilize different app types such as web apps, desktop apps, and Android apps, our dataset is created by utilizing Android apps exclusively. Focusing solely on Android apps makes the dataset more homogeneous and efficient. The produced dataset consists of 38 source code class metrics and contains 7,530 instances, with 6,844 negative instances and 690 positive instances. We evaluated our dataset using five ML algorithms. The results show that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the others. Further, our results show that the constructed dataset achieved promising results, with an F-measure value above 0.71."

Performance metrics like battery status (SOC), range, battery power, and current can be monitored in a variety of scenarios. A nonlinear energy consumption model serves as the foundation for the simulation, which accounts for physical forces including road slope, rolling resistance, and aerodynamic drag. Furthermore, in negative power conditions, the system considers battery charge and mimics the regenerative braking process. Each vehicle's time series data is shown graphically so that energy efficiency comparisons can be conducted.

In this study, we propose an adaptive RUL prediction method for nonlinear degraded devices with random failure threshold by utilizing the adaptive Wiener process. Firstly, the nonlinear degradation model incorporating adaptive drift is developed based on diffusion motion. The RUL life distribution, defined by the first hitting time, is derived while accounting for the impact of random failure threshold. Subsequently, the model parameters and the random failure threshold distribution are estimated offline based on historical monitoring data. Meanwhile, we employ the Kalman filter technology to dynamically update these estimation model parameters. Finally, the proposed method’s effectiveness is verified through a case study involving gyroscopes."

    "abstract": "Rolling bearings are key parts of mechanical device, and performance degradation and failures may cause system downtime or damage. Therefore, predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling bearings accurately is crucial for effective equipment maintenance. To address the problems of laborious feature extraction processes, insufficient feature extraction, and low prediction accuracy of traditional methods, we propose the model named ETCN-BiGRU for predicting rolling bearings' RUL, which combines the temporal convolution and bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and employs the efficient channel attention. We utilize dilated convolution to extract both local and global features for the ETCN-BiGRU model simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed model incorporates the BiGRU to capture the temporal relationships between the rolling bearings' sensor data, which is collected in both forward and backward time steps. Moreover, the ECA is employed in the TCN-BiGRU network to enhance the channel dimension's feature representation capacity. Experimental results of the PHM 2012 bearing datasets show the proposed model can accurately predict rolling bearings' RUL. The ETCN-BiGRU model has higher prediction accuracy and better stability than the comparison models."

    "abstract": "The palm oil industry, a vital component of the global agricultural economy, generates substantial amounts of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME), which poses significant environmental hazards if not properly managed. Traditional methods of POME treatment are often labor-intensive and inadequate for real-time monitoring, leading to potential regulatory non-compliance and environmental degradation. This paper aimed to develop a novel Smart POME Wastewater Monitoring System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, integrating real-time sampling with ammonia monitoring and mobile app or web based visualization. The primary objective was to continuously monitor critical water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and ammonia nitrogen across different treatment stages: Concrete Pond, Final Discharge Pond, and Anaerobic Pond. The methodology involved the integration of advanced sensors with IoT-enabled data acquisition and transmission systems, facilitating real-time data collection and analysis. Water samples were collected from the specified ponds to validate sensor accuracy and performance. Testing was conducted in phases, starting with system setup and calibration, followed by continuous monitoring and periodic data validation. The expected outcome was a robust monitoring system that provided accurate, real-time data on POME quality, enabling prompt corrective actions and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. The results demonstrated significant improvements in monitoring efficiency and environmental management. The conclusion underscored the system’s potential to revolutionize POME management, promoting sustainability and regulatory adherence in the palm oil industry."

In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate. Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels."

We derive new closed-form expressions to characterize the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for individual users and the system as a whole. Through extensive simulations covering various antenna configurations and signal-to-noise conditions, our analysis confirms that the NOMA protocol can provide superior security compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in certain operational domains.

A comparative review of the most widely used VR devices in educational environments is presented, including tethered, standalone and hybrid systems. Their technical characteristics, ease of use and applicability in different educational contexts are all also analysed. The report outlines device selection criteria, integration strategies and key recommendations for effective implementation in the learning process based on real-world cases and practical examples. The main advantages of learning through VR are highlighted – increased engagement, the ability to visualise complex concepts and the safe practice of risky or expensive simulations. Despite challenges such as high costs, cyber sickness and the need for teacher training, the increasing availability of standalone VR systems (e.g., Meta Quest 3, PICO 4) reveals the potential for their wider application, including in budget-constrained educational institutions. The report concludes with conclusions about the importance of the right choice of hardware and integration with teaching methodologies to achieve effective and modern education."

    "abstract": "The fed-batch penicillin fermentation process is inherently complex and nonlinear due to the sensitivity of microbial growth and product synthesis to environmental and operational conditions. Conventional control methods like Exponential Feeding (EF) or fixed strategies, lack adaptability when faced with dynamic process changes. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), offers a model-free approach that enables an agent to learn optimal actions through environmental interaction using rewards and penalties. This study employs a reinforcement learning-based adaptive control technique to dynamically adjust the feed rate in penicillin fermentation, with the objective of maximizing productivity while minimizing substrate inhibition. A streamlined kinetic model incorporating substrate inhibition and product synthesis was written in MATLAB. The RL controller employs a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework to determine the ideal feed rate, with the reward function structured to promote penicillin production while penalizing high substrate concentration. The feed rate action space had increments of 1 L/h and covered 0 to 50 L/h over a 400-h batch time. According to the simulation findings conducted under both nominal and variable initial conditions, the RL controller maintained the residual substrate concentration below 0.003 g/L while achieving a total batch penicillin product ranging from 141,858 g to 148,523 g. This adaptive approach shows potential for intelligent, reward-driven process control that optimizes fed-batch penicillin production."

This research proposes an enhanced position control strategy that combines a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)—an optimal control method—with a disturbance observer, eliminating the need for a current control loop. The LQR is designed to minimize both position and stator current errors, thereby ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and effective load handling. To further improve control performance, the disturbance observer estimates the load torque and uses it to compute the reference current. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations under two types of load conditions: constant load and position-dependent variable load. The results are also compared with a conventional cascade control structure that includes current and position controllers in the inner and outer loops, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust temperature monitoring of rotating and high-temperature components remains a critical challenge in automotive Test & Measurement, particularly during dynamic vehicle testing. Traditional wired sensing approaches, such as thermocouples, are not viable for components in motion, while current wireless solutions often fail to withstand the harsh conditions of critical subsystems like brake assemblies, wheel rims, and powertrain interfaces. Moreover, commercially available passive RFID tags with integrated temperature sensors are typically limited to operational temperatures below 130° C, rendering them unsuitable for applications where temperatures can exceed 250° C. In this work, we present the design and characterization of a novel passive RFID-based sensing architecture for high-temperature applications on rotating vehicle components. The system is based on the AS2312 UHF RFID chip by Asygn, which enables direct interfacing with external resistive sensors. A thermally robust sensing node is realized by integrating an NTC thermistor via a half-bridge configuration, with the RFID chip and antenna placed in cooler zone and the sensing element positioned near the thermal hotspot. Inlab characterization demonstrated the feasibility of measuring temperatures exceeding 250° C with an RMSE of 16.5° C, mainly concentrated at low temperatures."

RFID tags, assigned to users, allow for contactless and secure identification, significantly reducing errors, preventing fraudulent activities (such as proxy attendance), and lessening the manual workload. The system’s performance is assessed based on scanning success rates, response times, and data synchronization. Various data visualization methods, including histograms, box plots, and heat maps, are employed to analyze attendance patterns.

    "abstract": "Plant diseases significantly have threatened the world agriculture through the decrease in food availability, economic sustainability and the survival of the farmers. The significance of timely and proper detection of plant diseases is that it helps to get them before they cause the outbreak thus curbing crop losses. Common methods of detection do not usually scale all the way given that they resort more on the skills of the personnel making the analysis. Plant disease can be diagnosed by using image data, and since the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) especially deep learning is very prompt, we focus into probing the task of detection and classification of plant leaf diseases based on Kaggle dataset, more than 53k plant leaf images, and 38 classes using deep learning techniques. Until the stage of pre-processing the image, learning model, measuring model performance, it has been taking an entire data science pipeline of the study. They employed the VIT trained and transfer learning based on the pre trained architectures like VGG19 and ResNet50. The significant issue was the imbalance and visual similarity of classes of disease during the data analysis which was mitigated by data augmentation and hyperparam optimization. VIT model produced validation accuracy of 99.7 % as opposed to VGG19 model whose accuracy was 80.56 %. The accuracy recorded on the last performance is 91.93 on the EfficientNet model. Since the solution to the identification of plant diseases turns out to be effective with preprocessing and model adoption through deep learning. It also aids to create AI driven tools of precision agriculture and demonstrates future works such as application of the models to the mobile and real time diagnostics to the farm systems."

Through comparative experiments of time-domain statistical feature analysis and deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, EMD-CNN-LSTM), the characteristics of micro-fault vibration signals were revealed: their amplitude indicators have certain discriminability for fault types but are prone to overlap due to noise interference. Deep learning experiments showed that the LSTM model has unique sensitivity to the time-series evolution patterns of micro-faults (such as slow amplitude increase and periodic phase distortion), achieving a classification accuracy of 99.08% on a self-built 7-class weak fault dataset, significantly better than CNN (93.01%). Although the EMD-CNN-LSTM model fuses multi-scale features, its accuracy is 95.22% due to limited feature discriminability under low signal-to-noise ratios. The research results can provide a reference for early fault warning of aero-engine bearings."

Silicon micromachining techniques were used to fabricate an inverted pyramidal structure, with an opening 750 μm × 750 μm, sidewall slope of 54.7° and an optical window of 30 μm <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">×</i> 30 μm at the bottom. To carry real-time spectroscopic measurements, while maintaining a liquid under test at controlled elevated temperatures, microheater structures surrounding the μCUV were designed. The design parameters were the dimensions of the silicon structure, microheater geometry, thickness of the heating element, and inter-element spacing. While several geometries were compared, simulation results indicate that due to the sloped sidewalls of the μCUV and presence of corners, multiple specially designed heaters at the top as well as the bottom of the structure are necessary to obtain a temperature variation of less than 8% across the inner surface of the μCUV. The silicon-based system can be directly integrated into on-chip control electronics catering to a wide range of applications. We propose a fast and versatile liquid test system based on our results."

    "abstract": "Phase coherent signal processing for radar imaging relies on the precise estimation and compensation of unavoidable manufacturing inaccuracies, component variations, and aging effects in multichannel radar systems, as these imperfections limit the achievable image quality and can even render target detection impossible. The demand for radars with higher resolution requires higher frequencies, bandwidths, and apertures, imposing more stringent requirements on calibration quality. Conventional calibration methods often offer limited quality while necessitating expensive positioning systems and large-scale anechoic chambers. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel calibration method for uniform linear array (ULA) single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar systems that can be performed outside an anechoic chamber, even in a highly reflective environment. Moreover, its setup requirement is limited to a single linear unit, enabling a practical and cost-effective calibration that avoids strict constraints on the measurement scene and equipment. This is achieved by enhancing and expanding an existing calibration technique that minimizes artifacts in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images caused by the coherent superposition of channel imbalances. As a result, these artifacts serve as a highly sensitive and precise metric for the calibration process, enabling an exceptionally high calibration quality while requiring the evaluation of only a few Fourier coefficients, thus ensuring low computational effort. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by calibrating a 77GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) SIMO radar system with an eight-element ULA receive (RX) antenna array in a highly reflective environment. The calibration quality is validated by comparing processed images from an independent test scene against uncalibrated data and the results of two other calibration methods."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation recognition is essential for large-scale wireless communications, but traditional methods often ignore unknown signals in open-set conditions, leading to their incorrect classification as known types and thereby compromising system reliability and communication security. To handle this challenge, a novel automatic modulation open set recognition (AMOSR) model based on deep metric learning with embedding enhancement is proposed in this article. First, for each known example, deep neural model is employed to separately extract the original in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signal and its instantaneous features, which are then fused to obtain embedding. Second, random erasing is employed to the original IQ signal and instantaneous features separately to obtain an augmented example, which has similar structure but different semantics with known example, and the embedding of this example is obtained by using first step. Then, the embedding space, in which tuplet loss and margin loss are combined with the embeddings of known and augmented examples, is trained to improve the overall performance of the model. Finally, after training, AMOSR is implemented using the class centers of known classes. Experiments on three automatic modulation datasets show that our model has better average performance than several mainstream methods in the field of computer vision."

To address this gap, we introduce a framework considering the three components of encoding, perception and cognition to examine the known benefts for visual information graphics and explore their applicability to tactile information graphics. This work establishes a preliminary theoretical foundation for the tactile-frst design of information graphics and identifes future research avenues."

    "abstract": "In scenarios with extremely harsh channel conditions and severely limited communication resources, the reliability and effectiveness of semantic communication require urgent enhancement to satisfy the increasing demands of 6G technology. To address this issue, we propose an importance prioritized framework that integrates both message importance and feature importance to identify critical semantics for reliable and efficient semantic transmission. Considering service personalization and task intelligence, we analyze the message importance by factoring the receiver’s preferences and the communication tasks requirements. Specifically, a large AI model is introduced to quantify message importance, while an importance-based metric for semantic accuracy is established to evaluate the overall reliability of semantic communication. To safeguard significant messages in harsh channel conditions, an unequal error protection strategy based on message importance is employed. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for feature importance analysis based on loss variation to accurately identify critical features. A feature importance prediction network is designed for algorithm deployment. Additionally, a semantic compression strategy based on feature importance is utilized to prioritize the transmission of essential features in limited communication resources scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate substantial performance advantages of our framework and methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio and communication resource shortages, providing a reliable and efficient solution for semantic communication in adverse communication environments."

However, their clinical applicability remains limited due to the heterogeneity of stenosis and plaque attributes, as well as confounders within the causal relationships of CAD diagnosis. This work introduces the Attribute-Decoupled Intervention Network (ADI-Net), a confounder-free CAD diagnosis framework designed for fine-grained analysis at both the artery and patient levels, aligning with real-world clinical practice. ADI-Net employs an attribute-decoupled representation that effectively captures the heterogeneous features of stenosis and plaque with differential constraints, enabling precise, fine-grained classification. Additionally, the dynamic-updating causal intervention continuously refines confounder banks and applies the Do-expression within a complete causality, ensuring comprehensive, cross-level assessments. Experiments on CCTA datasets from three clinical centers demonstrate that ADI-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-level, fine-grained CAD diagnosis, exhibiting superior robustness, domain adaptability, and data efficiency."

    "abstract": "Rapid and precise movements of industrial equipment necessitate reference trajectory design to mitigate motion-induced vibrations, which becomes more challenging in the presence of system uncertainties. This article develops a novel trajectory planning method based on an improved cosine jerk model to robustly suppress residual vibration under actuator limits. Incorporating tunable asymmetry into the model allows trajectories to start faster and shorten motion duration. By applying a linear transformation in the complex domain, the vibration suppression capability is extended to accommodate both undamped and damped systems. The profile parameters are modulated to align the intrinsic trajectory zeros with the system poles, attenuating spectral components near the critical modal frequency that excite resonance. Unlike much current work that provides only partial solutions or requires numerical optimization, a complete analytical solution is derived for all possible trajectory types using a designed coefficient that manages the acceleration ratio. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated experimentally across different systems. The results show that the proposed method can achieve better vibration mitigation performance under modeling errors than existing benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Real aperture radar superresolution imaging of sea surface targets has significant applications in sea surface surveillance and maritime rescue. However, its performance rapidly deteriorates when the echo data of the valid targets are merged into the strong sea clutter. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-feature divide-and-conquer (MF-D&C) framework by forming a complex multi-feature enhancement network (CMFE-NET) and data-divide-and-conquer-based (DD&C-based) sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm. First, to separate sea clutter echo from valid targets’ echo, a CMFE-NET is proposed to transform the complex echoes into four distinct feature spaces: amplitude, phase, frequency, and dwell time. Second, based on the separated sea clutter echo and the valid targets’ echo, a DD&C-based SBL algorithm is proposed to perform Bayesian parameter estimation on both the clutter and target components, which improves the model parameter estimation performance within the Bayesian framework. Finally, a parameter pruning solver is introduced in EM estimation to eliminate inactive parameters during the iterative super-resolution process, significantly reducing computational overhead. The proposed framework demonstrates superior capabilities resolution enhancement in sea surface target superresolution imaging."

This article presents a brain emotional learning (BEL)-based active balancing method that jointly regulates SOC and cell temperature within a unified, adaptive control policy designed to handle operating variability and measurement uncertainty. The proposed approach is evaluated against proportional–integral, model predictive control, and deep reinforcement learning controllers through case studies on a heterogeneous battery pack model in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, and further validated using both a virtual prototyping platform and a control hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. Results demonstrate that the BEL-based approach achieves faster convergence, greater robustness to measurement noise, and improved long-term balancing performance compared with all benchmark methods."

However, this monolithic integrated structure inherently introduces thermal interference issues, directly limiting the system's temperature measurement accuracy. In this work, we designed a monolithic integrated thermopile infrared sensor developed using standard CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) process technology and conducted thermal interference coupling analysis and temperature compensation studies based on its structural characteristics. First, through structural analysis of this type of sensor, we identified the presence of thermal mismatch between the hot and cold ends, as well as thermal transient temperature rise phenomena. The former manifests as spatial temperature imbalance causing static error, while the latter manifests as temporal temperature changes causing dynamic error. Subsequently, we experimentally validated these two types of errors and constructed a static reference correction model combined with an RC network dynamic compensation model, achieving synergistic suppression of both types of thermal interference. Experimental results show that after static reference correction, the static deviation caused by thermal mismatch between the hot and cold ends decreased from 0.22°C to 0.06°C, with an error reduction of 73%. After dynamic temperature compensation, the dynamic error caused by the self-heating temperature rise of the tube shell decreased from 0.42°C to 0.08°C, with an error reduction of 80.9%. This study provides the theoretical basis and compensation methods for improving temperature measurement accuracy in monolithic integrated temperature measurement systems."

We introduce shorting vias at the horn aperture based on composite right/left-handed transmission line (CRLH TL) theory, enabling ENZ mode operation in the non-uniform aperture with broadened bandwidth, which surpasses the bandwidth limitation of conventional waveguide ENZ antenna. A SIW operating in the ENZ mode is employed as the feeding network, which excites a four-element shared-aperture array through slot coupling. A dipole array integrated with a reflective structure is introduced to create a magneto-electric complementary radiation mechanism, thereby enhancing endfire gain. The radiation pattern function of the antenna is derived and validated through full-wave simulations and measurements. Measured at 24.39 GHz, the prototype exhibits a peak gain of 12.03 dBi, a total efficiency of 84.2%, and a sidelobe level of -21.1 dB under an in-phase excitation via a single feeding point.

Harmonic tags are batteryless devices that, when illuminated by an electromagnetic wave from the reader, reradiate a signal at a harmonic frequency, enabling robust operation in highly cluttered or interference-prone settings. Conventional harmonic tags often rely on wire-based dipole structures that, although very lightweight, are limited in performance and scalability. The proposed tag features an asymmetric folded meander-line dipole antenna printed on an ultrathin 25 μm flexible polyimide substrate that is directly matched to a low-voltage Schottky diode at fundamental and second harmonic frequencies (2.9 GHz and 5.8 GHz, respectively). This dual-band antenna design enables improved harmonic backscattering efficiency while maintaining a minimal form factor of 15 mm × 11.8 mm and a total weight of 22 mg. The tag demonstrates a significant improvement in conversion efficiency of up to 18 dB over traditional wire-based designs, effectively doubling the detectable range. Performance evaluations were conducted through simulations and experimental measurements in an anechoic chamber, validating the effectiveness of the tag in free space. The proposed harmonic transponder provides an efficient and scalable solution for smart sensing and tracking applications where size, weight, and robustness are critical."

The risk of manual diagnosis errors is relatively high due to large numbers of samples and complex morphology. Automated detection of vaginal secretions through fluorescence microscopy is essential; however, current methods fall short of meeting clinical requirements for detecting vaginal inflammation pathogens. To establish an efficient and accurate system for detecting vaginitis pathogens at the cellular level, this study has created a high-quality fluorescence microscopy image dataset of vaginal secretions with sufficient samples, named VagFluor. To address issues such as artifactual interference, blurred boundaries, and cell adhesion occlusion in the VagFluor dataset, this study has proposed a new algorithm for auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis: MDC-Net. The feature extraction stage has introduced a full-dimensional adaptive module that retains complete information from the cell edge to the bacterial colony, enhancing model sensitivity. Additionally, a cross-stage multi-scale spatial pyramid pooling module has been built, which can capture subtle discriminative features in non-central positions of similar categories. Furthermore, a multi-channel feature fusion module has been introduced to guide the network in focusing on target details, effectively resolving the problem of feature confusion. Experimental results have demonstrated that MDC-Net can achieve higher accuracy on the VagFluor dataset than current state-of-the-art detectors."

    "abstract": "The development of personalized wearable devices, including orthopedic products, requires individual customization to ensure user satisfaction and sustained usage over time. Recent advances in image-generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as DALL-E from ChatGPT, have shown promise for creating individualized designs tailored to user preferences. However, the structured integration of such AI tools into broader iterative product development workflows (including 3D-modeling, personalization, and physical manufacturing) remains largely unexplored in this application context. This work presents a user-centered design process that incorporates image-based generation into early design phases to address both functional and aesthetic user needs. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the process, resulting in the design and fabrication of a customized foot orthosis using additive manufacturing. To assess the design outcome, the prototype was evaluated through a subjective user questionnaire and supplemented by qualitative feedback from an orthopedic professional. The results highlight both strengths and limitations of AI-assisted workflows in personalized product design. Overall, the findings illustrate how AI can be effectively embedded in user-centered design processes and provide implications for applications beyond orthopedic footwear design."

To ensure a realistic evaluation, we curated a benchmark dataset from three public sources, divided into five test subsets representing diverse operational scenarios. Our results reveal that pre-trained models consistently surpass scratch-trained counterparts, underscoring the importance of leveraging prior knowledge.

This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines to assess the performance of integrated renewable energy systems across tropical climate zones. A comprehensive search of IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases identified relevant studies that record key parameters, including Köppen-Geiger climate zone classification, system configurations and capacity ranges, performance metrics and efficiency data, economic parameters (CAPEX, OPEX, LCOE), and the duration of the validation methodology. Analysis reveals significant performance variations across all renewable technologies in tropical conditions, with integrated photovoltaic-wind-battery systems demonstrating superior performance compared to standalone configurations. Economic analysis indicates that an optimized levelized cost of electricity can be achieved through proper system integration. The review identifies promising research areas, including long-term validation datasets, enhanced modelling approaches, and comprehensive environmental impact assessment. These findings lay the groundwork for developing tropical-specific design frameworks to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in rapidly developing tropical regions that host substantial global populations."

    "abstract": "Many existing frequency-domain fault detection approaches rely on only a subset of the information contained in multi-sensor data, typically focusing on frequency-domain features or simple inter-sensor coupling. To enhance detection performance, this study introduces a fault detection framework based on wavelet time–frequency representations. First, the wavelet transform is employed to generate time–frequency maps that reveal the temporal evolution of different frequency components within the signals. These maps are then segmented along the time axis to enable a more detailed extraction of local time–frequency patterns, after which the covariance matrix of each segment is calculated to characterize sensor correlations. Finally, a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) is designed to perform fault detection using the covariance matrices as inputs. Experiments conducted on the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset verify that the proposed method effectively captures both time–frequency information and inter-sensor dependencies, achieving strong accuracy and robustness in multi-sensor fault diagnosis."

Traditional methods for creation of test cases are not efficient to handle complex problems in which causing error and resulting in difficulties in the overall testing method. Automated test case generation is an approach to solve these difficulties in testing and helps to increase efficiency and software quality. This paper presents a method to improve the test case development process by integrating machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. ML methods, such as supervised and reinforcement learning, are used to predict ideal test cases based on the past defect patterns, while NLP methods will process and understand the software requirements and user stories to automatically generate relevant test scenarios. Transformer-based language models and deep learning classifiers are used inorder to extract and structure test cases from natural language specifications. The results obtained show a considerable increase in test coverage, defect detection rates, and overall reliability. A comparative analysis of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing-based models such as combinations of classification algorithms and language representations shows that combining both approaches helps to enhance the overall performance of test case generation, as measured by evaluation metrics showing improvements in test coverage, defect detection rate, execution time, precision, recall, and a reduction in the false positive rate. The proposed method reduces human labor and speeds up the testing process while retaining accuracy and effectiveness. Finally, deal with the potential for merging advanced deep learning models with large language models (LLMs) to refine automated test case production and increase software quality."

    "abstract": "With cities expanding at an ever-increasing rate and the number of people in urban centres increasing even further, efficient waste management is among the key challenges in building smart, sustainable cities. Traditional waste collection practices fail - as bins overflow and conditions become unhygienic, with increased operations cost on the inefficient routes. In order to solve this, our research presents a HSM which is a hybrid smart dustbin system that will make waste management smarter, cleaner, and more energy-efficient.Using IoT technology, the system monitors bin fill levels in real time using ultrasonic sensors. It also includes global system for mobile communication module GSM. As the container fills up to its maximum level, the system will automatically notify the control centre that the bin is full. At the same time, it sends an SMS alert to the assigned driver for garbage collection with the exact bin details that should be attended to immediately. This prompt notification mechanism ensures that waste is removed in time avoiding overflow. The solution is helpful in minimizing unnecessary pickups and fuel consumption hence reducing both environmental and economic costs.Besides waste level monitoring, the system is equipped with an air purification feature that triggers under the presence of dust or odor – enhancing the surrounding hygiene and air quality around the bin. Powered by a AQI sensor and a 12V fan which is controlled through a relay module and controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. A small LCD display with indications of system status on the spot, and everything is powered from a solar battery providing independence from external sources and the absence of the load on the environment.This paper describes the design of the system, its hardware elements, and logic of its communication. The results demonstrate that our smart dustbin not only increases the efficiency of waste collection, but also improves the cleanliness of urban areas — practical and scalable solution for smart cities."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid power-frequency multiple access (HPMA) framework for enabling successive interference cancellation (SIC)-free ambient backscatter communication in low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Unlike conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems that require SIC at receivers, the proposed HPMA design leverages both orthogonal and non-orthogonal subcarriers to allow multiple users to coherently combine their signals without interference cancellation. A passive backscatter device (BD) modulates information onto a carrier emitted by a base station, reflecting both user-specific and superposed signals to end users. We develop a unified analytical model under Nakagami-m fading and derive exact closed-form expressions for outage probability and throughput using the Meijer G-function. Asymptotic analysis further reveals the system’s diversity behavior and the impact of bandwidth and power allocation. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that HPMA achieves significantly better performance than NOMA in terms of outage and throughput, especially in the low-to-moderate SNR regime. The proposed scheme offers a promising solution for SIC-free, energy-efficient, and spectrally efficient communication in large-scale IoT deployments."

To predict the power of the backscattered signal (BS) from the total power in the presence of an interfering direct signal without using complex signal processing algorithms, a power-centric theoretical model based on the phase difference of the interference between the AmBC signal and the direct signal (DS) is proposed for 5 G-NR free space. As a first approach, only a direct continuous wave (CW) signal at 3.5 GHz was considered. Knowing the BS power level is important for estimating the potential AmBC range. Knowing the ratio of AmBC power to the direct signal power (in dB) is also important for a robust reception of the AmBC signal without interfering with the active communication systems. Predicting this ratio allows to check if AmBC could co-exist with active communication by examining the interference at the legacy receiver (LR)."

Contemporary compression methodologies primarily employ uniform compression strategies across diverse input instances, neglecting the inherent variability in computational requirements among different examples. In this paper, we present a distinct example-aware adaptive layer pruning framework that dynamically orchestrates transformer layer selection contingent upon input complexity characteristics. Our methodology incorporates a compact policy network architecture that generates binary activation masks for individual layers, allowing for personalized computational resource allocation per input instance. Through the implementation of differentiable Gumbel-Sigmoid relaxation mechanisms, we enable end-to-end optimization protocols while preserving classification accuracy. Comprehensive empirical evaluation on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) corpus demonstrates our approach achieving 93.0% classification accuracy while utilizing just 3.81 layers on average from the complete 12-layer architecture, yielding a substantial 3.15 × compression ratio. This methodology outperforms established compression techniques including DistilBERT, TinyBERT, and conventional static pruning approaches, establishing a superior equilibrium between accuracy preservation and computational efficiency in BERT compression paradigms."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) development in all major fields including healthcare, finance, and intelligent infrastructure raised the need for private, transparent, and secure learning systems. Federated Learning (FL) addresses data privacy by enabling parties to cooperate to train machine learning models without sharing their raw data; however, conventional FL paradigms are based on central aggregators, which introduce vulnerabilities such as single points of failure, decreased transparency, and trust issues among the cooperating parties. This work proposes a novel theoretical framework that integrates blockchain, smart contracts, and Federated Learning to develop a fully decentralized, secure, and auditable AI training platform where smart contracts manage major processes like model aggregation, verification, and reward distribution, disentangling third-party coordination. Blockchain is used as an immutable ledger that openly keeps track of all the updates to the models and participant behavior, enhancing auditability and building trust. The design further incorporates a token- based reward system that will be used to incentivize honest behavior and discourage malicious behavior, addressing root problems of data poisoning and free- riding. This decentralized approach not only improves data confidentiality and system resilience but also promotes fairness and accountability in multi- stakeholder settings. By conceptual analysis and theoretical modeling, the paper lays the foundation for an ethical and scalable AI system that takes advantage of the strengths of Federated Learning, blockchain, and smart contracts, which is a key step towards decentralized intelligence without compromising privacy, integrity, or trust."

    "abstract": "In today’s digital era,iInformation spreads quickly on social media and online platforms in the current digital era. This makes it more difficult to discern reliable sources from fake content, which promotes the spread of fake news even as it makes communication easier. The public is misled by such disinformation, which also erodes confidence in trustworthy media. This study uses Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to create a real-time fake news detection system. The dataset includes 10,000 news articles, evenly divided between real and fake, each containing a title and full text to capture linguistic and semantic patterns. The system uses a pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to process text. Tokenizing and transforming articles into contextual embeddings makes it possible to identify minute syntactic and semantic variations. The detection framework combines dropout regularization (50%) and BERT with fully connected layers (64 neurons, tanh activation). Binary classification is carried out by a sigmoid layer. Training employs learning rate reduction, early stopping, batch size of 100, and a learning rate of 1 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−5</sup>. Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves, Cohen’s Kappa, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Brier Score, and Log Loss are all included in the thorough model evaluation. Word clouds and subject distributions are examples of visualizations that draw attention to the linguistic distinctions between fake and real news. The hybrid framework, which blends content-based analysis with potentially context-aware analysis (e.g., source credibility and propagation), is a significant contribution. The two-pronged strategy significantly increases the reliability of early detection by both preventing misinformation and protecting the integrity of digital ecosystems."

Epileptic seizures are unstable and have considerable health implications, so early diagnosis is essential to enable timely action. For that purpose, the hybrid deep learning method that involved Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks was examined. Four state-of-the-art CNN-LSTM-based models ChronoNet, CNN-LSTM, EEGNet + LSTM, and ConvLSTM were implemented to extract both spatial and temporal patterns in EEG signals. A total of 3,200 EEG recordings were gathered from several participants over six months, with a series of experiments conducted in controlled clinical settings. The EEG signals were preprocessed with denoising, normalization, segmentation, and feature extraction to make them ready for model training. Each of the models was trained and tested to identify EEG patterns into interictal (normal), preictal (prior to seizure), and ictal (during) states. All of these performances were measured through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrices. Amongst all the models, ChronoNet performed the best with accuracy as 98.76% and AUC-ROC as 0.997, making it the most suitable model to deploy in real-time. This study illustrates the capability of deep learning to provide accurate, efficient, and automatic seizure prediction in wearable and clinical monitoring systems."

This study offers a new approach to extracting and analyzing the features of sheet metal parts. First, the metal parts are manually separated from the background, creating a clean dataset. Next, semantic segmentation methods are applied to accurately identify the different components and features of the metal parts. Using machine learning techniques, this segmentation enables accurate determination of the features of metal parts. The extracted features include metrics like maximum area, aspect ratio, rectangularity, elongation ratio, perimeter length, circularity, thinness ratio, and the lengths of the longest and shortest axes. These features can be used later to determine similarity rates between original and machined metal parts. These techniques play a key role in improving quality control and operational efficiency in sheet metal production. By analyzing the accuracy of feature extraction and comparison, they ensure more reliable and accurate outcomes. This method provides an analysis of metal part features and helps refine manufacturing processes."

    "abstract": "The paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel IoT-based smart irrigation system that combines soil moisture sensing, real-time weather data, artificial intelligence, and cloud monitoring to tackle water waste in agriculture. The system is built around the ESP8266 microcontroller, which collects data from soil sensors and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to make smart irrigation decisions based on both current soil conditions and predicted rainfall. ThingSpeak is integrated to create a user-friendly dashboard that farmers can access remotely through a web interface. When the system as tested against traditional methods, it was found that AI-enhanced approach cut water consumption by 27-40%, while the machine learning algorithms continuously improved irrigation scheduling by learning from historical patterns. This research offers a practical contribution to sustainable farming through an affordable, scalable solution that boosts crop yields while using significantly less water."

    "abstract": "In practical industrial processes, measurement data collected from various sensors are often contaminated by uncertainty due to measurement noise and unknown disturbances. These uncertainties introduce undesirable spikes into the process data, which can significantly impact subsequent fault detection. To overcome this problem, this study develops an improved interval principal component analysis (PCA) fault detection approach capable of handling data uncertainty. First, Uncertain single-valued data are transformed into interval representations using sensor manufacturer–specified error bounds to better capture their underlying characteristics. Second, an improved interval PCA method is designed, which integrates multiple algorithms to obtain the smallest possible interval eigenvalues. Using the obtained interval eigenvalues and eigenvectors, high-dimensional interval data are projected onto a lower-dimensional space for feature extraction. Finally, four monitoring statistics are established to assess process states and identify faults. Simulation experiments on the BSM1 benchmark indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in fault detection."

While the application of deep learning has yielded significant advancements in this domain, present models mostly adopt RNNs or combined model methods for prediction. In this article, we propose a spatial-temporal convolutional network(STCN) to predict the RUL of aircraft engines based on data from multiple sensors. This model extracts the spatial-temporal features of the input sequence from three dimensions: variable, feature and time series. Empirical validation on the C-MAPSS benchmark dataset confirms the efficacy of the STCN approach. The methodology achieves an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 13.73 and an average scoring of 697.87."

In high-frequency carrier scenarios, such as millimeter wave (mmWave), several users may operate in the near-field region. Then, the beamforming is designed for near-field users and can transmit information to far-field users using the NOMA technique. Recently, machine learning approaches have been explored to enhance beamforming performance; however, their application to pairing and power allocation for far-field users in near-field massive MIMO-NOMA systems remains underexplored. In this study, we propose an integrated model not only for beamforming but also for far-field users that pairs with near-field users. The simulation results show that the proposed approach improves the average data rate for far-field users to approximately 2.19 bps/Hz compared to Greedy-Branch and Bound (BB), while maintaining the data rate of nearfield users at a predefined level."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of MOSFET and BJT switching devices in a DC–DC boost converter operated over the 20–100 kHz range. Both devices are evaluated under identical operating conditions to isolate the influence of switching frequency on converter performance. Analytical models for conduction, drive, and switching losses are established, and results are verified experimentally using time-domain waveforms and thermal measurements. Normalized performance indices are introduced to combine efficiency, thermal behavior, and output ripple into a composite score. The MOSFET consistently obtains outstanding indices over the studied frequency range, with a composite score hovering around 0.8 and peaking at 0.84 at 50kHz. In contrast, the BJT composite score drops from 0.34 at 20 kHz to 0.19 at 100 kHz, indicating storage-dominated turn-off loss and constant base-drive power consumption. Switching energy tests show that the MOSFET decreases dynamic loss by 74-78% compared to the BJT, resulting in a smaller thermal increase. Harmonic spectrum research indicates that the MOSFET has lower distortion and better ripple shaping as well. The findings indicate that MOSFETs are the preferred devices for boost converters operating above 50 kHz, offering a more favorable trade-off among efficiency, thermal stability, and harmonic performance."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT devices has increased the demand for efficient computational technology. While cloud computing offers vast resources, its centralised structure causes high latency, network congestion and unreliable connectivity, making it unsuitable for real time applications like autonomous vehicles, industrial automation and smart healthcare. Edge computing solves these issues by processing data closer to users but limited resources at edge nodes lead to congestion, increased energy consumption and task queuing. To address this issue this paper presents a priority based task offloading model using an M/M/1 queuing system to optimise task execution. The model prioritise high priority tasks and distributes normal tasks across other Edge nodes based on their energy levels and queue lengths. An energy aware offloading mechanism is introduced with energy regeneration which allows Edge nodes to recover energy during inactive periods which enhances system longevity. MATLAB based simulations evaluate performance metrics like waiting time, packet loss and energy consumption. Results shows a 92.65% reduction in task waiting time, zero packet drops and improved energy efficiency compared to random selection models. The proposed model enhances system responsiveness and optimise energy which makes it highly suitable for real time applications that demand low latency and reliability."

Using the time-varying system matrices, the parity equation is constructed. Then, the assessment indices of fault detectability are introduced using Euclidean distance for system analysis, where prior information on actuator and sensor faults are taken into account. Furthermore, an optimization strategy based on an H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−</inf> / H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</inf> function is introduced to design the parity space-based residuals. Based on this, a residual-based measures are proposed to analyze the detection performance. These two indices support the evaluation of detection performance, which can provide guidance for determining the parameters of the parity space-based diagnosis approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations on the flight control system of an unmanned automotive vehicle (UAV)."

The antenna consists of two stacked microstrip patches that are fed by a microstrip line through a resonant aperture. An equivalent circuit is proposed for the antenna consisting of three LC parallel resonators, out of which two resonators are inductively coupled and two resonators are capacitively coupled. The equivalent circuit is de-embedded from the antenna response by means of the least squares method, and the dimensions of the antenna are adjusted in such a way their equivalent circuit matches the response of a broadband third order filter. The reference filter is used as a mean to ensure broadband matching of the antenna. Following this design strategy, a broadband ASP antenna has been designed, fabricated and measured at a center frequency of 5.5 GHz with a bandwidth of roughly 45%."

    "abstract": "Solid-phase fraction (SPF) is a critical parameter in solid-liquid two-phase flow, and can be measured using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with electrical resistance tomography (ERT) measurements. But CNNs can estimate SPF from the time series of ERT measurements under stable conditions rather than under rapidly changing flow patterns and complex measuring conditions. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel multi-scale hybrid Mamba-CNN model, termed State Space CNN (SSC). Compared with CNNs, the SSC has linear scalability and synergistic integration between global state-space patterns from the Mamba module and local spatiotemporal features from CNNs. Moreover, SSC presents a robust modeling of the complex multi-scale temporal dynamics and conductivity-related ambiguities present in the ERT measurements. Experiments shown that the SSC significantly outperforms existing CNNs, and can achieve a 34.2% re-duction in MAPE (12.3% vs. 18.7%) and a 19.7% reduction in MAE (2.41 vs. 3.05). Consequently, the SSC provides a robust solution for accurate, real-time SPF estimation and enhanced accuracy in dynamic complex measuring conditions."

Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel, explainable, and weather-independent day-ahead load forecasting (DALF). The proposed methodology integrates calendar-based segmentation using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), hybrid modeling with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and post-hoc error correction via Generalized Least Squares with Autoregressive Residuals (GLSAR). To enhance interpretability, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are employed to quantify the influence of lagged load features and calendar variables across segmented forecasts. The framework is evaluated on real-world half-hourly data from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), encompassing both regular and holiday-specific load profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLR–GPR–GLSAR configuration achieves superior performance, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.72% and an R² of 0.99, outperforming Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), and Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (NHITS), as baselines. The proposed framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for utilities operating in data-sparse environments. These findings affirm the importance of residual autocorrelation correction and calendar-aware segmentation in advancing DALF accuracy and transparency."

    "abstract": "Interference cancellation based on spectrum sharing is a key solution to improve the network performance of multi-satellite systems. In this paper, we investigate a user-centric multi-satellite communication system where users are collaboratively served by multiple satellites. In this system, the integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks, i.e., the satellite-to-user access network and the gateway-to-satellite backhaul network, are jointly considered. Our objective is to maximize the weighted sum rates (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing the beamformers of multiple satellites and the gateway while considering the backhaul link constraints. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, a centralized algorithm is developed using the block coordinate update (BCU) method, assuming that global channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known. In addition, a low-complexity distributed algorithm based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) is further proposed. This approach offers enhanced flexibility for implementation in multi-satellite systems and adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithm based on MA-DRL can achieve a performance almost equivalent to that of the centralized algorithm. It also reveals that the spatial diversity can be fully exploited through the joint beamforming of a multi-satellite system compared with a single-satellite system, while the growing number of satellites makes the backhaul constraint a more critical bottleneck for system capacity."

    "abstract": "Resonances originating from the concept of bound states in the continuum have been shown to produce high quality factors and strong field enhancements. Here, an ultra-sensitive terahertz metallic metasurface based on bound states in the continuum is developed to address the limited sensitivity of terahertz sensing technology. The metasurface employs a u-shaped resonator and a l-shaped resonator as the unit cell, and a resonance around 0.7 THz can be excited. The analysis of the quality factor and the band structure confirm that this resonance is induced by bound states in the continuum mode. Based on the calculations, it can be concluded that the frequency shift changes linearly as a function of analyte thickness within the range of 0 μm to 10 μm, and the sensitivity can be as high as 151 GHz/RIU. The feasibility of the detection of chlorpyrifos concentration in soybean oil is assessed experimentally, and a liquid cell is applied as sample holder to maintain the sample in a liquid state. It can be concluded that the metasurface enables effective detection of chlorpyrifos in soybean oil, with a limit of detection as low as 0.007 mg/L. Our work enables the detection of trace chlorpyrifos in soybean oil, facilitating the application of terahertz technology in food safety."

As WTGs are tasked with providing frequency regulation in response to the challenges of low system inertia caused by renewable energy integration, the WTG ancillary frequency controllers can induce undesired torsional vibrations in the drivetrain system. Moreover, WTG torsional vibrations can also be electromechanically excited by grid voltages or mechanically induced by changes in wind speed. To address undesired WTG torsional vibrations, this study proposes a hybrid control scheme that combines linear controller and sliding mode controller (SMC) to mitigate torsional vibrations in WTGs using a BESS. The contribution of the paper lies in extending BESS applications and presenting an efficient control scheme for mitigating WTG torsional vibrations when the microgrid is subjected to unplanned islanding and wind speed variations. Time-domain simulations are conducted to validate the analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

In the commutation strategy, only the coils underneath the magnet array are energized to reduce the computation burden. The physically constrained data-driven wrench model (PCDWM), considering the end-effects of the coil and magnet array, is introduced in the real-time (RT) control system to distribute the coil current at each control cycle. The H bright circuit driving every coil independently maintains the low cost and high efficiency with the inherent parallelism of the FPGA, promising the synchronous driving of each coil. In the experiments, the constructed prototype realizes a micro-meter positioning resolution. A series of comparative tests highlights the lower power consumption of the driving method and the better motion decoupling performance resulting from the data-driven wrench model (DWM)."

Since the FIB size is orders of magnitude larger than IP routing tables, scaling it to store millions of prefixes in SRAM/TCAM memory in programmable switches is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose a Compressed FIB data structure called CoFIB, designed to run on edge programmable switches in an SDNbased environment. The CoFIB is a collection of exact-match tables placed in an optimized manner in both ingress and egress pipelines. We propose a LNPM algorithm that carefully recirculates packets in the pipeline. We also introduce the concept of canonical name prefixes to reduce memory footprint and propose an algorithm to extract canonical prefixes from the Routing Information Base (RIB). Experimental results show that CoFIB can compress memory up to 16.58× compared to the state-of-the-art, with no significant impact on throughput compared to hardware-based solutions. Additionally, our proposed table placement optimization for LNPM increases the number of packets processed at a line rate by 23.17% compared to the linear table placement approach using a large NDN name dataset."

    "abstract": "High-power pulse systems often require stacking multiple thyristors in series to withstand high operating voltage, yet the optimal number of devices for maximizing pulse performance has remained unclear. This work develops a behavioral model for the pulse current in series-connected thyristors that links device-level conductivity modulation with circuit-level behavior. First, the drift region resistance of thyristors under high-current pulse conditions is characterized, accounting for drift region conductivity modulation in devices of different voltage ratings. This device behavior is then incorporated into a RLC discharge circuit model to derive analytical expressions for key pulse parameters, including the peak current (Ipeak) and current rise rate (di/dt). The model reveals how increasing the number of series-connected thyristors can strengthen conductivity modulation and reduce the drift region resistance, thereby improving Ipeak and di/dt up to an optimal point. Simulation and experimental validations are presented for various operating voltages and configurations. The results show that the proposed model predicts the pulse current waveform and performance metrics for different series counts, matching measured waveforms closely. The model, for the first time, provides a quantitative design tool for high-voltage, highcurrent pulse power systems, and offers guidance on determining an optimal number of series-connected thyristors to achieve the best pulse performance."

This article proposes a multi-point dynamic temperature prediction method for magnetic couplers, integrating multiphysics finite element simulation with a deep learning algorithm to achieve real-time, accurate prediction of temperature variations under ambient temperature fluctuations, coil misalignment, and continuous charging conditions. First, an electromagnetic-thermal coupled model is constructed using the finite element method to generate temperature datasets under various operating conditions. Then, the random forest algorithm analyzed the influence of input parameters on temperature predictions at different timesteps, screening key variables as model inputs. A dynamic temperature prediction model combines long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with a temporal self-attention mechanism. Finally, the model outputs show that the method outperforms conventional prediction accuracy and speed approaches. Finally, a 3.3 kW experimental prototype was built to simulate continuous charging scenarios under varying coil misalignment conditions, with real-time temperature acquisition at key locations of the magnetic coupler. Experimental results show average prediction errors of 5.7%, validating the correctness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Pre-rake processing is a pre-filtering technique implemented at the transmitter. This method pre-aligns the transmitted signal with the anticipated characteristics of the wireless multipath channel, thereby simplifying the receiver’s design. This method is particularly effective in time division duplex (TDD) direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS/CDMA) systems, where it leverages channel reciprocity. However, an inherent asymmetry exists between the uplink and downlink channel responses in Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems. This lack of channel reciprocity can degrade the performance of pre-rake processing, leading to suboptimal results in certain scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a matched filter-based rake receiver with multiplexed pre-rake filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although symbol multiplexing introduces inter-symbol interference (ISI), this interference can be effectively suppressed using a minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter. Furthermore, the accuracy of channel estimation, critical to the performance of pre-rake filtering, can be significantly enhanced by employing linear or quadratic interpolation methods, enabling more robust prefilter design even under high Doppler frequency conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed system improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional approaches, particularly in rapidly varying channel environments."

First, we design the OCSSA algorithm by integrating the global optimization capability of the Ospreys Search with the local perturbation mechanism of Cauchy mutation, enabling adaptive optimization of both the penalty factor and mode number in variational mode decomposition (VMD). This effectively mitigates modal aliasing issues. Subsequently, an end-to-end deep diagnostic framework is constructed to extract the time-frequency fusion features of the decomposed signals using CNNs and introduce gated recurrent units (GRUs) to model long-term dependencies in the sequences, thereby improving the recognition of weak fault features. Experimental validation on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods,achieving 99.67% fault recognition accuracy and 3.92-second diagnostic latency, which highlights its strong generalization capability and engineering applicability."

To address this challenge, a robust diagnosis scheme based on voltage correlation compensation and kernel independent component analysis (KICA) is proposed. First, a modified correlation coefficient and KICA-based abnormal sample separation strategy is designed to extract normal samples affected by cell inconsistency. Then, the voltage relative slopes between each cell voltage and the reference voltage are updated based on the normal samples. Within each interval, the voltages are corrected using the updated voltage relative slopes, and the residuals between the corrected and reference voltages are further modeled using the KICA model to detect ISC faults. Finally, the faulty cell is identified and located using a cumulative relative partial contribution rate method. Experimental results on a real LIB pack platform demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong adaptability under conditions of cell inconsistency and poor data quality."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in processing and interpreting complex, real-world information that spans text, images, audio, and video. However, they often struggle with tasks requiring deep, verifiable reasoning, particularly when external knowledge is needed. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems can fetch relevant information but lack a sophisticated mechanism to synthesize it through a transparent reasoning process. Concurrently, Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) Methods generate reasoning steps but often hallucinate information not present in the provided context. This paper introduces a novel architecture that synergistically integrates these two paradigms. Our system employs a dynamic, rationale-guided retrieval process where the intermediate reasoning steps generated by an MCoT module actively refine subsequent queries for the RAG component. This iterative loop between reasoning and retrieval allows the model to dynamically seek and ground its thought process in high-precision, contextually relevant information. Our experimental results on the ScienceQA and A-OKVQA benchmarks show that this architecture significantly outperforms traditional unimodal and multimodal models in both accuracy and the faithfulness of its generated explanations."

    "abstract": "Anemia and other hematological disorders represent a major global health burden, affecting over 1.6 billion people, particularly women and children. These conditions are often underdiagnosed due to limited access to diagnostic resources and medical infrastructure. In recent times, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a valuable tool for the prediction and identification of such disorders using structured clinical data, hematological parameters, and medical imaging through techniques like Deep Learning and Machine Learning. This review systematically analyzes studies published between 2019 and 2025 that applied AI methods to predict or classify anemia and associated disorders. Research articles in English were retrieved from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, with 25 relevant studies selected based on defined inclusion criteria using the PICOC framework. Findings show that AI models often achieve high performance, with accuracy frequently exceeding 80 percent, and strong sensitivity and specificity. Supervised learning approaches were the most applied and consistently effective. Despite these promising results, challenges remain in clinical validation, data variability, and model interpretability. This review highlights the growing role of AI in medical diagnostics and underscores the necessity for strong, transparent, and widely models for reliable use in the clinical environment."

    "abstract": "Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) coordinate the operation of batteries and supercapacitors, enabling rapid energy absorption and release in microgrids. By effectively smoothing fluctuations between renewable generation and load demand, they ensure a stable and reliable power supply. Consequently, efficient control strategies for HESS are critical to enhancing overall microgrid performance. Model Predictive Control (MPC), with its ability to handle multivariable constraints and predict future behavior, has demonstrated excellent performance in HESS control. However, conventional MPC typically assumes that the battery voltage remains constant throughout the prediction horizon, leading to accumulated model errors and inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Extended State Observer Model Predictive Control (ESO-MPC) method. In this approach, the unmodeled battery voltage dynamics are treated as an unknown disturbance, with ESO used for real-time estimation and compensation, thereby updating the system state and improving control accuracy. Simulation results show that the ESO-MPC method significantly reduces DC bus voltage ripple and battery current ripple in an HESS microgrid, thus enhancing system stability and power quality."

This paper presents a comparative framework for detecting and mitigating outliers in traffic datasets using statistical, density-based, and machine learning methods. By injecting synthetic anomalies into traffic simulations, we evaluate the impact of outlier removal on downstream speed modeling. The proposed pipeline integrates outlier detection with speed estimation through regression and smoothing models. Key contributions include a unified empirical evaluation of six detection techniques, robust speed recovery using regression models, and a replicable methodology for anomaly-aware traffic speed estimation.

    "abstract": "Android malware propagation poses increasing security risks to mobile ecosystems, with conventional detection techniques fighting an uphill battle against advanced evasion strategies and polymorphic variants that take advantage of static analysis limitations. Existing approaches including signature-based detection and conventional machine learning techniques have moderate performance against advanced obfuscation techniques and cannot capture complex structural relationships inherent in malicious code execution behavior. These limitations necessitate advanced techniques capable of carrying out in-depth structural analysis and dynamic pattern detection for malware detection. This paper proposes a new hybrid deep learning technique that combines Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis with Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DeepGraphCNNs) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to overcome current limitations. Our technique meticulously reverse-engineers APK packages, decompiles Dalvik bytecode to extract CFG representations and utilizes sophisticated graph embedding methods (DeepWalk, Node2Vec, Word2Vec) in the feature transformation process. The experiment is conducted on 2,349 samples from CICMalAnal2017 and MalwareBazar. Our DeepWalk-DeepGraphCNNs and TCN model demonstrated superior performance with 95.10% accuracy and 93.67% AUC-ROC. Our experimental results ensure the success of the technique for addressing contemporary Android security issues."

Therefore, financial sustainability and efficient use of resources become more important. In this context, electronic payment and money institutions must be able to forecast their revenues and plan accordingly. Developing revenue forecasting models is a strategic action that significantly contributes to the financial planning processes of electronic payment and money institutions. In this study, models have been developed using machine learning-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) to forecast the weekly and monthly revenues of an electronic payment and money institution. The study also analyzed the effects of feature selection and lookback (LB) integration on forecasting performance. Revenue forecast models have been developed for two different weeks and two different months. The performance of the developed models has been evaluated by Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE). The findings indicated that the SVM and CatBoost models provided comparable results for different months and weeks. Different effects have been observed for LB and FS integrations. This suggests that factors such as seasonality and variability in data patterns should be considered in the model selection process."

The shield consists of a planar grid of unit cells based on a Jerusalem Cross structure surrounded by an external metallic grid, each integrating varactor diodes controlled by passive RFID Integrated Circuits (ICs), enabling batteryless and distributed programmability. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations demonstrate a transmission coefficient variation exceeding 30 dB between shielding and transparent states, with excellent transparency and angular robustness with respect to the incident field.

    "abstract": "Ensuring reliable radio connectivity in next-generation wireless networks is critical, particularly under dynamic weather-induced impairments that significantly influence link stability. Traditional Radio Link Failure (RLF) prediction approaches primarily focus on binary classification, failing to estimate when a failure is likely to occur. In this work, we propose a novel weather-aware RLF prediction framework that integrates multi-modal feature fusion, contrastive representation learning and survival analysis to produce interpretable time-to-failure estimates. Using a real-world dataset from Turkcell comprising radio key performance indicators (KPIs) and measurements from weather stations, we first employ a supervised autoencoder to learn a fused latent representation of triplet-based meteorological features. A contrastive autoencoder trained with triplet loss then captures discriminative latent embeddings, stratifying links into high and low reconstruction error groups. Survival analysis, leveraging Kaplan–Meier and Nelson–Aalen estimators, demonstrates that higher reconstruction errors correlate strongly with accelerated failure risk, providing actionable insights into temporal link reliability. Furthermore, we incorporate Isolation Forest anomaly detection on learned representations to enhance predictive capability under imbalanced data conditions. Experimental results show that our proposed methodology achieves robust performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of RLF, enabling proactive resource allocation, optimized handover scheduling, and informed Service Level Agreement (SLA) risk management in weather-sensitive wireless environments."

    "abstract": "Natural disasters generate vast amounts of multi-modal social media content on platforms like Twitter, containing both textual and visual information crucial for emergency response. However, existing disaster monitoring systems often analyze text and images in isolation, leading to incomplete situational awareness and delayed crisis response. This study proposes a comprehensive multimodal framework that integrates natural language processing and computer vision techniques through a context-aware late fusion strategy. Our system employs a dual-pipeline architecture: the text pipeline utilizes XLNet for binary disaster detection, BERTweet for 16-category disaster type classification, and Gemini for zero-shot semantic intent analysis (Disaster Information, Emergency Help, and Emotion Sharing), while the image pipeline applies EfficientNet-B4 for informativeness assessment, humanitarian categorization, and damage severity evaluation. The multimodal outputs are integrated using weighted voting, where weights are assigned proportionally to each model’s validation accuracy, and validated against ReliefWeb for real-time verification. Experimental results on the Disaster Tweets Normalized and CrisisMMD datasets demonstrate exceptional performance: XLNet achieved 98% F1-score for disaster detection, BERTweet attained 96% F1-score for type classification, and Gemini reached 94% F1-score for intent analysis. EfficientNet-B4 showed consistent performance across visual tasks with F1-scores of 82% (informativeness), 76% (humanitarian), and 65% (damage severity). The multimodal fusion approach significantly outperformed unimodal baselines, successfully prioritizing critical disaster events through severity-based ranking, thus providing emergency responders with actionable intelligence for effective crisis management."

This paper provides a strong hybridized ensemble model that is able to forecast with great accuracy and outcome concerning the assessment of heart disease. The model combines the advantages of various classifiers thanks to the combination of stacking and soft voting algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression) and achieves better predictive results. The suggested system was trained and tested using a combined record set of UCI and Kaggle consumer bases, which contained 1100 records of patients with 16 clinical parameters. Severe preprocesses and feature selection methods were used in order to increase the effectiveness of the model. The fourth hybrid model had the highest accuracy of 94.8%, precision, and recall, and an AUC-ROC score of 0.96, which proves that it is better than the traditional and individual ensemble models. The criterion of data feature importance confirmed the clinical importance of such attributes as type of chest pain, ST depression, and exercise-induced angina as well. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the model as an accurate clinical decision support engine in the detection of heart disease at an early stage. Its implementation can largely support health care providers to make better diagnoses, treatment plans, and minimize cardiovascular risk."

It is thus suitable for underwater communication environments that are time-varying and doubly dispersive, i.e., with significant delay spreads and high Doppler shifts. In this paper, the statistically equivalent underwater acoustic (UWA) channel model that considers both small-scale and large-scale perturbations is implemented, and the channel is represented in the delay-Doppler domain. In the receiver design, the performance of three equalization techniques of increasing complexity, namely, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), maximal ratio combining (MRC) in delay-time, and the message passing algorithm is examined. Simulation results show that the MRC delay-time detector can most effectively equalize the UWA channel with a large number of delay and Doppler coefficients. The time-domain LMMSE equalizer is preferable in sparse channel conditions due to its low complexity."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a compact microstrip patch antenna array designed for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). The design begins with a foundational quarter-wavelength patch antenna, which is then miniaturized by approximately 20% by properly adding two side slots and two stubs. To enhance the antenna’s performance, an I-shaped Defected Ground Structure (DGS) is etched into the ground plane between the MIMO elements, effectively improving inter-element isolation. The final 2-port MIMO antenna features a compact overall size of 0.36λ× 0.36λ × 0.02λ and operates from 3.55 to 3.60 GHz. Throughout this band, the antenna maintains isolation greater than 24 dB and a broadside gain exceeding 2.4 dBi, making it a suitable solution for compact IoT devices."

    "abstract": "The performance of satellite communication systems strongly depends on line-of-sight (LoS) conditions between the satellite and the ground terminal. This paper presents a data-driven approach for predicting satellite visibility periods using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The model is trained on simulated beacon signals characterized by received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and Doppler shift values, generated for one-year period based on realistic orbital parameters and the 3GPP TR 38.811 S-band propagation model. The dataset includes both LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, incorporating obstruction effects caused by a cylindrical obstacle. Once trained, the proposed LSTM model predicts satellite visibility for a stationary ground terminal solely from downlink radio signal features, without requiring two-line element (TLE) data, ephemeris information, or terminal location. This enables efficient, real-time classification of LoS and NLoS conditions for satellite communication links."

    "abstract": "In this Paper a fully functional 5.8 GHz RFID system for item level tracking of surgical instruments based on the EPC Gen2 protocol is presented and tested in realistic scenarios. Design considerations are elaborated, the main system components are examined and measurements with multiple instruments in a metallic medical sieve are shown. An instrument's ID can be read with high reliability, although being arranged chaotically in the sieve with multiple other instruments in a single scanning procedure. A maximum read range of 61 cm utilizing a completely passive tag was achieved using 2 W ERP output power in measurements with a single instrument in a metallic environment. This technology is able to identify individual instruments of a surgical set inside a sieve or opened container almost instantly, even when the tag is partially covered by other instruments. Therefore, it is conveniently usable, as instrument sieves only need to be placed under a scanning antenna and all instruments being identified automatically."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have emerged as a suitable solution for chipless RFID tag detection. However, key considerations for AI-based detection approaches include the generalization capability of the models and their deployability on computationally limited embedded digital signal processors, for their use in real-world applications. This paper presents a brief review of recently presented AI models in the literature. We evaluate the models' generalization capabilities by training and testing on measurements collected at different times, without guaranteeing the same exact set-up. Deployability is assessed based on two indicators: memory requirements and computational cost. The provided results manifest the necessity of evaluating AI models on entirely distinct datasets, with observed differences in accuracy of up to 0.2319 between testing on a subset of the training dataset and testing on a distinct dataset. The memory requirements of all the presented models indicate that they could be stored on simple embedded digital signal processors, with the largest model requiring less than 35 MB of memory. However, most of the models are computationally expensive, with the most demanding model requiring more than 825 million floating-point operations to perform an inference."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of Dyna-Q Learning algorithm in temperature process control especially in the chemical batch reactor. Since the precise control of temperature in batch is the most important aspect to ensure stability, safety and yield. The application of Dyna-Q Learning algorithm is rare especially in chemical process. This might be due to Dyna-Q complexity when it is used to control continuous process which is full of uncertainty especially in the chemical batch process. In most of the existing studies, Dyna-Q is used for discrete process control. There is still study gap in Dyna-Q Learning on the continuous process control such as chemical batch process. In this paper, the algorithm will implement with discretized version of temperature error as the state of the system and the increment and decrement of the fluid temperature as the action of the system. Both Dyna-Q and the conventional controller will be tested under both nominal and robustness cases to evaluate the controller’s performance. The Dyna-Q controller performs equally as the conventional controller in nominal cases but improves by 86% in terms of temperature overshoot in robustness cases. This project shows Dyna-Q is capable of continuous process control. This result further supports the future integration of reinforcement learning type of control in continuous processes especially in chemical processes."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) networks have led to a dramatic increase in wireless data traffic, thereby exacerbating the issue of spectrum scarcity. Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) enhances spectral efficiency by reducing subcarrier spacing and allowing spectral overlap, at the cost of orthogonality loss, which introduces severe Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). In frequency-selective multipath environments, the combination of ICI and multipath effects significantly degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance. Despite its potential, the robustness of SEFDM under fading conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel receiver architecture that utilizes sector antennas to spatially separate multipath components based on their Angle of Arrival (AoA). Additionally, we evaluate a sector selection scheme optimized for SEFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed sector selection method effectively mitigates the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) while improving BER performance."

To address this, paper propose an automated system leverages advanced machine learning techniques—including logistic regression, decision trees, and deep learning models—to accurately distinguish between authentic and fabricated news. The system evaluates language patterns, sentiment, and source credibility to assess the veracity of information. Trained on true and false samples of news, the model learns day by day to detect misleading content and applies fact-checking mechanisms.

To enhance the trajectory tracking accuracy and robustness of the spacecraft during the entry phase, this paper proposes a trajectory tracking guidance method based on a Linear Expanded State Observer (LESO) combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC). First, the LESO is utilized to real-time observe and estimate the unknown mismatched disturbances and model linearization errors in the system, thereby achieving compensation for lumped disturbances. Secondly, by leveraging the rolling optimization capability of MPC, an optimal control law is designed to enable the spacecraft to accurately follow the predetermined trajectory under external disturbances and system uncertainties. Simulation results demonstrate that this method exhibits strong robustness and control performance in the trajectory tracking task during the Mars entry phase, effectively improving guidance accuracy and significantly reducing trajectory tracking errors."

Traditional fault detection methods usually have difficulty generalizing to new operating modes, especially when only limited samples are available. Moreover, industrial data commonly contain anomalies introduced by sensor malfunctions or external disturbances. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a Mixture of Probabilistic PCA framework enhanced with a shared–private subspace decomposition and a sample-level weighting mechanism. The resulting model improves robustness to outliers and enables more effective extraction of global structural information across multiple modes. Industrial case studies show that the proposed method achieves superior fault detection performance, particularly under zero-shot and noisy new-condition scenarios."

This category imbalance problem significantly reduces the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model, making its recognition accuracy of rare faults insufficient. To address this challenge, an imbalanced sample fault diagnosis method based on knowledge-associated spatio-temporal features is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of data to enhance the model's ability to discriminate the minority class of faults. The method adopts a hybrid architecture of graph convolutional network (GCN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) to mine the spatial topological information and dynamic temporal features of the process variables, respectively, and then fuses them to obtain more discriminative knowledge-associated spatio-temporal representations. To further optimize the model performance, a two-stage training strategy is adopted: firstly, the generic feature representation is pre-learned with the majority fault class; then, the sample number of the minority fault class is used as the benchmark, and all fault classes are randomly sampled to construct a balanced sample set to fine-tune the model and improve its adaptability to the minority class. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified on the TE dataset."

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of photovoltaic (PV) installations supports renewable energy monitoring, capacity assessment, and policy planning. We introduce a deep learning framework for the simultaneous segmentation of rooftop (RTPV) and ground-mounted (GMPV) PV systems from 0.2m aerial imagery. The approach integrates automatically generated labels from registries and crowdsourced geographic information data with a small set of manually refined annotations, enabling scalable training with high spatial fidelity. A dual-head U-Net++ with a ResNet50 encoder jointly performs pixel-wise segmentation and image-level classification, reducing false positives in heterogeneous landscapes. Exemplarily applied to the state of Hesse, Germany, the model achieves a balanced accuracy of 87.52%, precision of 94.74%, and a recall of 82.89%, with F1-scores of 75.75% (RTPV) and 88.65% (GMPV). Coupled with solar suitability data, the results indicate rooftop PV utilization of only 3.24% statewide and 2.5% in the Dietzenbach case study. This implemented deep learning framework is the first high-resolution, single-step multi-class PV segmentation applied at the federal state scale, offering a transferable tool for large-area PV monitoring."

    "abstract": "Clustering-based prediction strategies have shown promising performance in dynamic multiobjective optimization. Most of them cluster a population by independent static positions of individuals and adopt a same prediction mechanism for subpopulations. However, this limits the preferred search tasks of clusters and tends to cause homogeneity of individuals. Therefore, this paper proposes a clustering individual changes-driven transfer learning and interpolation strategy method. First, a subpopulation prediction strategy based on clustering of individual features divides populations into different clusters and designs different prediction mechanisms based on the preferences of clusters, aiming to enhance the prediction accuracy of subpopulations and guide individuals to evolve in promising directions. Second, a nearest neighbor interpolation strategy inserts new objective points to sparse regions of the current Pareto optimal front according to neighboring point information, improving the geometric distribution. Third, a dual-source domain adaptation mechanism is presented to further increase the adaptability of solving problems with various types by integrating knowledge learned on two most useful environments. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method over six state-of-the-art competitors on the benchmark suite and good engineering applicability on a real-world task."

    "abstract": "In the domain of intelligent consumer electronics, edge devices such as monocular cameras increasingly demand the ability to perform multiple visual perception tasks simultaneously, including semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and boundary detection. However, most existing multi-task dense prediction frameworks suffer from inefficient task interaction and limited feature integration, which significantly constrain their applicability in resource-constrained consumer environments. To address these limitations, we propose a Quaternion Inter- and Intra-task Interaction Strategy (QIIS), a unified framework designed to enhance task collaboration through quaternion-based feature fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Dual-stream Patch Embedding (DPE) module to extract rich local features, a Cross-prompt Quaternion Interaction (CQI) block to achieve efficient inter-task communication, and an Intra-Task Quaternion Fusion (ITQF) module that enables effective fusion of task-generic, task-specific, and cross-task representations. By leveraging the Hamilton product inherent in quaternion convolution, our approach enhances representational capacity while reducing parameter complexity. Experimental results on the PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that QIIS achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks, with parameter and FLOPs counts that are generally lower than those of state-of-the-art methods, making it a viable solution for vision-based measurement and perception in embedded consumer systems.The code is available at https://github.com/hallynight/QIIS."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a resilient distributed secondary control (DSC) framework for the islanded ac microgrids to maintain the frequency and average microgrid voltage at a nominal value during cyber intrusions. In ac microgrids, any false data injection (FDI) in state variables used in DSC leads to frequency and voltage deviations. This affects the performance of connected loads and the undesired operations in the microgrids; at times, this may extend to disruption or destabilization of the ac microgrid. In this article, a steady-state FDI attack impact analysis on the conventional distributed controller is carried out to determine the deviations in terms of attack magnitude and controller parameters. Further, to mitigate the deviations, the auxiliary variables are incorporated into the conventional cooperative active and reactive power loops. The cooperative errors derived from the auxiliary variables are used to nullify the attack impacts on frequency and voltages. A steady state impact analysis is also presented for the proposed distributed control with an FDI attack to show the convergence of frequency and average voltage of the ac microgrid to its nominal values. An eigenvalue-based analysis is performed to optimally select the proposed controller gains. The proposed method is validated for various case studies in simulations and experimentally on a hardware setup for multiple communication link and local measurement FDI attacks."

Most previous studies are based on broadband satellite data, and the use of hyperspectral infrared data for pyroCb detection has not been explored. Australia’s unprecedented fires at the end of 2019 to early 2020 induced an extreme pyroCb outbreak, and the largest event occurred on 30 December 2019 was successfully captured by the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) onboard JPSS-1 and S-NPP. Analysis of these CrIS data demonstrated that the slopes and standard deviations of the spectral brightness temperature (BT), derived from a linear fitting to the spectrum in 800-980 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>, along with the split-window technique using selected CrIS channels, can aid in pyroCb detection. An inverted “V” feature in the spectra near 9.6 μm is associated with high pyroCb, and its depth, H_index, can provide information of cloud top height. These characteristics are verified through radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations and analysis of another case of pyroCb induced from California Creek fire on 5 September 2020. It is found that a combination of H_index and BT difference between 1231 and 677 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup> is promising to distinguish high pyroCbs. A more accurate determination of pyroCb plume height can be achieved from the single Field of View Sounder Atmospheric Products (SiFSAP), which indicate that several pyroCb pixels reach 3-6 km above the tropopause. These approaches could be applied to study more pyroCbs using over 20 years of hyperspectral sounder data."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a new flyback-integrated phase-shift full-bridge (PSFB) converter to improve the overall efficiency of the conventional PSFB converters for applications requiring low output voltages and high output currents. It is implemented by replacing the output inductor with a coupled inductor and connecting its secondary side to the output in a flyback configuration. During the freewheeling period, the proposed converter transfers the energy stored in the coupled inductor to the output via the flyback circuit, consisting of only one coupled inductor winding and a low-voltage-rated diode. This provides the following main advantages: 1) elimination of the circulating current; 2) a lower forward voltage drop on the freewheeling diode; and 3) a reduced number of conducting components. Consequently, power losses on both the primary and secondary sides are significantly reduced. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed converter, a 300 W prototype was designed and tested. Experimental results confirmed an improvement in overall efficiency compared with the conventional converters, achieving 0.8% and 2.2% higher efficiency than the center-tapped rectifier and coupled inductor rectifier, respectively, under full-load conditions."

    "abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are expected to provide greater flexibility and manageability for next-generation IoT networks. In this context, network services should be modeled as Virtual Network Function Forwarding Graphs (VNF-FGs). A key challenge is efficient allocation of resources for sequentially arriving network service requests, a process known as VNF-FG placement. Most existing algorithms either manually or partially extract features from the physical network and VNF-FG or adopt a greedy approach, allocating resources as long as a feasible solution exists, which may over-allocate resources to VNF-FG requests, ultimately harming infrastructure providers’ long-term revenue. In this paper, we propose a VNF-FG placement and admission control algorithm based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, called EAC. It consists two levels of agents: a coarse-level agent that generates placement strategies and rejects requests with no feasible placement strategies, and a refine-level agent that implements admission control and rejects requests that are detrimental to long-term revenue. To fully capture the topological features of both the physical network and the VNF-FG, we employ a customized Graph Attention Network (GAT) that incorporates link feature awareness and enables deeper exploration. To fully explore historical temporal information for admission control, we construct state triples and feed them into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the foundational training algorithm, the corresponding agents are trained hierarchically. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EAC algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of acceptance rate, revenue-to-cost ratio, and long-term average revenue."

    "abstract": "Neural-network-driven (NN-driven) network functions and their implementation on the data plane are emerging topics due to demonstrated accuracy and high performance. Meanwhile, we argue that deploying NN-driven network functions should satisfy two design goals: the generality to support various NN models, and the flexibility to operate various network functions. Unfortunately, existing work cannot satisfy both goals simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the Intelligent Plane for NN-driven network functions, and propose DP4C, a cross-plane SoC architecture that integrates the intelligent, control, and data planes within a single chip. DP4C comprises the programmable NN inference engine that iteratively executes inference to ensure model generality in the intelligent plane, a multi-core RISC-V CPU that parses inference results into diverse network functions through its architectural flexibility in the control plane, and the switch fabric in the data plane. To further eliminate the performance bottleneck, we propose (i) the direct register access mechanism coupled with custom instructions to reduce the overhead of cross-plane data migration; and (ii) the multi-core pipelining with adaptive batch-processing for multi-core CPU. DP4C SoC is fabricated using 130 nm technology and has already been deployed in industrial IoT environments. We also design three distinct test cases to evaluate DP4C, fully demonstrating the model generality and operational flexibility."

Blockchain can improve transparency among transaction parties and reduce transaction costs through consensus mechanisms and automation, offering a more efficient solution for managing trade credit. This study investigates how and to what extent blockchain affects trade credit. The empirical analysis is based on data from firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges (A-share market) during the period 2015-2022. The results show that blockchain implementation reduces received trade credit from suppliers, whereas it increases provided trade credit to customers. A series of robustness procedures-including alternative variable constructions, lagged specifications, alternative identification strategies, and placebo-based Monte Carlo simulations-confirm the validity and stability of the empirical findings. This study further investigates the mechanisms of how blockchain implementation affects trade credit. The results show that blockchain implementation further reduces received trade credit from more centralized suppliers. In addition, the results also indicate that more trade credit will be provided to customers with a higher level of demand uncertainty. This study offers a comprehensive view of how firms utilize blockchain to improve trade credit efficiency. Managerial implications based on the research findings are also provided."

In the traditional fiber or radio-over-fiber communication system, signal-signal beat interference (SSBI) is a critically destructive factor to be canceled. In this work, a nonlinear matched filtering (NMF) approach is proposed to transform the SSBI from a destructive interference into a constructive component for the THz ISAC system. By reusing the energy from the constructive SSBI, the NMF significantly enhances the sensing metrics in terms of the resolution and the peak-sidelobe ratio (PSLR). Using NMF can attain higher resolution with limited bandwidth; the larger the bandwidth, the better the effect. In experiments, a self-coherent ISAC system operating at 144-GHz center frequency and 5-GHz bandwidth is demonstrated with a 20-Gb/s communication capacity and a 1.94-cm ranging resolution. More importantly, the 3-dB resolution is improved by up to 25% and the PSLR is increased by up to 8 dB for the sensing function. In addition, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the integrated signal is reduced by up to 7 dB."

Recent studies have focused on task-specific and neuroscience-agnostic fNIRS classification models rather than a unified neuroscience-informed framework. We propose LoBrAFrame, a unified, neuroscience-informed fNIRS classification framework that leverages local brain activation patterns through a shared brain activation (SBA) module with a shared weight mechanism. SBA encodes shared activation dependencies into knowledge-aware hypersignals. A lightweight shared branch captures global spatio-temporal activation dependencies. Within this framework, researchers can easily enhance classification performance using simple or off-the-shelf methods on hypersignals, without redesigning complex models. To instantiate a concrete model, we introduce Mamba, a state space model, into the fNIRS domain and propose LoBrAMamba to learn activation patterns from hypersignals. Subject-specific and subject-independent experiments demonstrate the generalizability of LoBrAFrame and the superiority of LoBrAMamba on three open-access datasets. Our work will inspire interest in neuroscience-informed fNIRS frameworks."

    "abstract": "Existing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) deceptive jamming algorithms for moving targets combine low-order approximation of the instantaneous slant range with 2-D separation processing or a method based on the fast Fourier transform and interpolation calculation to rapidly generate the jammer’s frequency response (JFR). However, these methods struggle to balance the contradiction between the jamming modulation accuracy and efficiency, especially when generating multiple moving targets with varying motion parameters. In addition, the echo signals of highly squint SAR system exhibit significant spatial variability and complex Doppler characteristics, which require the jammer to increase the azimuth sampling rate and construct complex cross-coupling terms, further exacerbating the contradiction. This article proposes a deceptive jamming algorithm for moving targets against highly squint SAR based on keystone transform (KT) and extended nonlinear chirp scaling (ENLCS). The algorithm effectively reduces the azimuth sampling rate required for JFR construction and eliminates the main range-azimuth coupling by separating the linear range walk term and introducing the KT. Based on the circular model theory, the algorithm accurately derives the spatial-variant high-order range cell migration and Doppler phase, which are constructed by introducing a quartic perturbation function and the ENLCS method, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm constructs the motion-parameter-related terms separately from the unrelated ones, reducing redundant processing steps and further improving jamming modulation efficiency. Simulation results and computational complexity analysis validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "WiFi-based indoor localization, supported by comprehensive infrastructure, is considered a highly promising solution. However, practical applications of existing WiFi-based methods often struggle due to dynamic antenna configurations and potential influence from obstacles, which can undermine the reliability of channel state information and frustrate localization. Even worse, environmental changes may lead to a domain shift, further degrading localization accuracy and system robustness. To address these problems, this paper introduces GraphFi, a novel system that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to deliver accurate and robust localization using nearby access points (APs). GraphFi designs two types of graph structures: intra-AP graph and inter-AP graph, to maximize the use of information from all available APs. They aggregate the local features among antennas within each AP and global features across APs, effectively addressing the problem of dynamic antenna configurations. Two specialized GNNs are utilized to derive accurate user locations from these graphs. Additionally, we introduce an anomaly detection method to identify and exclude obstacle-affected APs. This method also employs a tailored GNN to mitigate influence from unpredictable obstacles. Furthermore, we integrate an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism based on a gradient reversal layer into GNNs. This helps maintain localization performance in a cost-efficient manner and ensures sustained effectiveness in a cross-domain setting. We prototype GraphFi using commodity WiFi devices and conduct extensive experiments in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that GraphFi achieves average localization errors of 0.17 m in a single-domain setting and 0.2851  m in a cross-domain setting, surpassing existing solutions in both precision and robustness."

Through rigorous ablation studies across two independent US equity markets (DOW30, SPY TOP40) spanning six years of institutional-grade 30-minute data (2019–2025), we expose a fundamental paradox: textitless connectivity yields superior performance. Three transformative discoveries emerge. First, sparse K-NN graphs with merely 400 edges achieve 5.1% superior QLIKE accuracy versus fully-connected graphs with 1560 edges (DM test, p<0.001), while delivering 74% computational savings—directly contradicting the prevailing \"more edges, better forecasts\" assumption. Second, explicit network topology modeling via GNNs provides statistically robust 52–55% accuracy gains (p<0.001) across both markets versus non-graph baselines, establishing graph structure—not architectural complexity—as the dominant performance driver. Third, our optimal sparse architecture achieves production-grade efficiency (12ms inference, 13.06 MB footprint), enabling real-time deployment at portfolio scale (e.g., S&P 500). We establish an evidence-based design principle: prioritize high-quality sparse connectivity (correlation ρ ≥ 0.766) over universal dense graphs. This work transcends incremental improvement, delivering a paradigm shift from complexity-driven to structure-driven financial AI."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving convolutional neural network framework for military vehicle images classification (LPP-CNN). Existing target classification methods primarily focus on improving accuracy and recognition efficiency but often overlook security threats during data transmission and processing, making them unsuitable for high-risk battlefield scenarios. Although some approaches incorporate image security through homomorphic encryption, the low efficiency and operational complexity of such techniques hinder their applicability in battlefield environments. To this end, we design a solution that integrates additive secret sharing with edge computing by encrypting images into two ciphertexts, which are then processed independently by two edge servers to prevent data leakage during upload. The encrypted data is subsequently processed by the LPP-CNN embedded with secure computation protocols. Finally, results are combined and decrypted to achieve target classification. This method ensures efficient and accurate military vehicle classification while significantly enhancing data privacy and security. Theoretical analysis demonstrates improved response speed and reduced communication overhead. Experimental evaluations show that under a classification accuracy not less than 94%, the computational efficiency of SComp, SReLU, and SMaxPool protocols increase by 32, 4, and 0.5 times, respectively, while communication costs decrease by 2, 2, and 13 times. The overall framework achieves a 33% improvement in computational efficiency compared to existing solutions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our framework not only meets battlefield requirements for high-precision object classification but also substantially strengthens data privacy and security, aligning more effectively with real-world military application demands."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of intelligent vehicle technologies, eco-driving control integrating velocity planning and energy management offers a solution to address charge and range anxiety in autonomous HEVs. However, due to complex road conditions, off-road eco-driving control has received limited scholarly attention. This paper proposes a novel integrated control system using a safe reinforcement learning (SRL) framework for eco-driving in off-road scenarios. First, we develop a method to identify safe velocity boundaries by quantifying constraints from complex road conditions based on vehicle dynamics stability criteria, deriving an analytical representation of the dynamic safe velocity boundary. Additionally, an SRL algorithm based on Lagrangian-SAC and an action-shielding mechanism is proposed, leveraging the advantage of model predictive control (MPC) in handling explicit constraints to guide safe actions while filtering unsafe ones during RL agent exploration. Finally, simulation and real-vehicle experiment results show that the proposed method effectively balances fuel economy and travel time while ensuring vehicle driving safety by strict safe constraints, achieving zero constraint violations in challenging off-road scenarios. Compared with the benchmark method, the fuel economy of the proposed method is improved by up to 6.12%."

A driven dynamical system creates such pairs, and a function can be learned on them that can reconstruct the underlying dynamics as in Takens delay embedding. The approach assures embedding stability unlike Takens delay embedding, and learnability, which can be absent, while stability can be present in the current reservoir computing framework. This accurately models underlying systems where recent methods like the next-generation reservoir computing fail. We demonstrate results and compare with the other methods, including SINDY-PI."

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) demand highly efficient, low-latency channel access schemes to support emerging applications. To capture the distributed nature of participating stations, we formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). Building on this formulation, we propose QIPPO/CA, a communication-efficient distributed channel-access method for collision avoidance based on the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) protocol. QIPPO/CA leverages independent proximal policy optimization (IPPO) within a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) paradigm. It is further extended with a federated learning–inspired quantized gradient update, enabling efficient coordination among distributed stations without exchanging local information. Extensive simulations demonstrate that QIPPO/CA (i) consistently outperforms legacy random-access methods such as CSMA/CA, (ii) achieves the performance of centralized training frameworks, (iii) remains robust under dynamic channel sizes and traffic loads, and (iv) substantially reduces communication overhead during agent training. These results highlight QIPPO/CA as a promising framework for scalable, efficient, and standard-compatible distributed channel access in NGWNs."

    "abstract": "Multiround iterative testability verification is key to ensuring the rationality and effectiveness of testability design and guaranteeing the realization of fault diagnosis capabilities. Existing testability verification technologies for diesel engines mostly fail to meet the demands of testability verification under complex stress conditions, and the level of automation of related methods is insufficient. To address the above needs, this paper conducts research on the testability verification integration technology of electronic control systems under complex stress conditions and constructs a universal and automated testability verification technical framework. This framework includes testability verification scheme design and evaluation, fault data sequential generation, target unit operating environment, and intelligent testing and interpretation.Meanwhile, considering the characteristics of the diesel engine electronic control system and its complex stress, this paper focuses on three core technologies: the testability verification profiling design technology considering complex stress conditions, the sequential fault data generation technology oriented to multi-source information, and the verification environment construction technology considering vehicle communication conditions. Finally, based on the constructed testability verification integration technology framework, three typical components—electronic control units, sensors, and actuators—are selected for case study and analysis. The testability verification is completed for five typical fault modes, and the verification results prove that the testability design is reasonable and effective. Therefore, the testability verification integration technology support the universal and automated testability verification of electronic control systems, thereby providing support for testability design and the realization of fault diagnosis capabilities."

Particularly, the UAV executes computation tasks for the UEs and measures the velocity of the targets requested by them. To simultaneously handle both the task offloading and target velocity estimation under the limited resources and hardware, the UAV exploits the signal sequences while its results return to the UEs based on the ISAC technique. In addition, we leverage the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRB) as the lower bound of the mean squared error of the velocity estimation as the sensing performance. Both the CRB and the computation offloading latency depend on the location of the UAV. We then optimize the UAV’s localization and the computing resource allocation to the UEs to maximize the system reward that is defined according to the offloading latency and CRB requirements of the UEs. We develop a genetic algorithm to solve this. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a safe model predictive control (Safe-MPC) framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), model predictive control (MPC), and control barrier functions (CBFs), aiming to achieve safe trajectory tracking of nonlinear systems in complex environments with obstacles. The proposed approach leverages PINNs to learn system dynamics from limited data while preserving physical consistency. The learned model is then embedded into the rolling prediction module of MPC, enabling accurate and real-time solvable control strategies. In parallel, CBFs are incorporated in a soft-constraint formulation to enforce safety constraints on the system states, ensuring that they remain outside unsafe regions throughout the optimization process. Simulation results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately track the reference trajectory and effectively avoid static obstacles. The system trajectory converges stably, validating the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method. Compared with traditional MPC methods based on explicit physical models, the proposed Safe-MPC framework exhibits superior performance in terms of modeling flexibility and tracking accuracy. Future work will extend the framework to higher-dimensional systems and validate its performance on real-world robotic platforms."

    "abstract": "The performance of an autonomous vehicle system is significantly influenced by sensor reliability and microcontroller limitations. Challenges such as limited detection range, environmental sensitivity, constrained processing power, and slower response can lead to delays and inaccuracies in obstacle detection and navigation. Although integrating various sensors in the system can overcome the detection range constraint, its real-time decision-making will be affected due to the increased data load. In addition, dynamic environments hinder the system’s path planning, as it requires robust real-time decision-making and adaptability. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to develop an autonomous vehicle system that can avoid obstacles in real time while travelling between designated points. This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of an autonomous vehicle prototype that uses a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm implemented on a microcontroller through integrated hardware and software. Performance evaluation in terms of efficiency, consistency, and reliability demonstrated the capability of the prototype to handle obstacles across various path types. Although the results show a decline in performance with an increasing number of obstacles, the findings serve as a basis for future enhancements of the developed system."

In this paper, we introduce a lightweight and highly efficient finetuning approach based on a compact vision-language model, Perception Encoder using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). Our work eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and costly full-model training by leveraging a pre-trained multimodal backbone, adapted to the TrashBox dataset containing 17,785 labeled images across diverse waste categories. QLoRA reduces training memory and time by more than 10× while fine-tuning only 1% of the model’s parameters, yet it delivers over a 10% improvement in classification accuracy compared to previous fine-tuning baselines and achieves competitive performance relative to transfer learning approaches. Furthermore, our method consistently outperforms conventional CNN-based classifiers across nearly all evaluation criteria. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that the few remaining misclassifications stem from labeling errors in the dataset rather than model limitations. Our findings establish QLoRA-tuned vision-language models as a state-of-the-art, cost-effective solution for real-world solid waste classification and broader environmental AI applications."

    "abstract": "Farming stays as the primary economic activity for a considerable portion of the population like in the case of India, which is still developing. However, the agricultural sector continues to face challenges and perhaps none is more damaging than plant diseases. Outdated approaches to plant disease detection typically involve a labor-intensive visual examination by skilled personnel, which not only is difficult for the remote areas lacking trained agricultural personnel, but also takes a long time. To resolve this widespread and serious concern, a comprehensive, smart, and easy-to-use system for diagnosing and managing plant diseases with the aid of advanced machine learning technologies has been proposed. The main setup of this system is a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model which has been trained on more than thousand labelled plant leave images. This dataset includes 38 categories of different crops, both diseased and healthy. The model has been wrapped in a RESTful web API using Flask, which enables simple integration with the responsive user interface implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A distinct aspect of the application is its functionality to cater both English and Hindi language speakers. This enhancement fosters a better remedy comprehension amongst users thus increasing proper disease management. The application also provides a voice assistant feature for the farmers. Based on our experimental, the CNN model was trained with a certain exponential clock and achieved over 87 percent accuracy yielding unmatched results on previously unseen test data validating correctness claims for a world of real implementation."

The aim of this study is to comparatively analyze the performance of BERT and ELECTRA models in detecting smishing attacks. For this purpose, the dataset used is compared for the first time in the literature. The tests show that the BERT model achieves a higher accuracy rate than the ELECTRA model in detecting smishing attacks.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new coded modulation framework for massive MIMO systems that leverages low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) alongside superposition-based 64-ary QAM modulation to increase spectral utilization efficiency. To address the complexity of signal detection, the proposed approach reformulates the original 64-ary QAM channel into an equivalent BPSK model. This reformulation supports a two-layer Tanner graph structure for the combined tasks of signal detection and channel decoding, with computational complexity that grows quadratically with the number of transmit antennas. Protograph LDPC (P-LDPC) codes are adopted in the system due to their excellent error correction performance, and integrates an \"equal-weight\" superposition constellation, which delivers a 0.7–1 dB gain in performance compared to the traditional \"equal-distance\" design under coarse quantization. Furthermore, the paper introduces a modified PEXIT analysis method that holistically accounts for the combined effects of MIMO fading, quantization noise from ADCs, and LDPC decoding characteristics. Simulation results confirm the reliability of the analytical approach and highlight the critical role of optimized power allocation in maintaining high energy and spectral efficiency in emerging 5G and 6G networks utilizing low-resolution receivers."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, data augmentation is playing a vital role in various deep learning applications, especially in biomechanical automatic analysis, where the features are hard to collect due to different sophisticated reasons. However, traditional data augmentation techniques expose their limitation by synthesizing unsuitable content that neglects the semantic, global content of the dataset. Furthermore, this problem even exacerbates the outputs of transformers, as these models normally require a large amount of data for training. Therefore, this study is conducted, introducing a new approach called Augmented-GPT that utilizes the GPT-4o as a generative AI agent and designs proper prompts to synthesize data, enriching the content of the dataset effectively by considering global content to create more relevant features for specific rare classes. As a result, our Augmented-GPT can assist the TabTransformer in reaching up to 81.0% in predicting the condition of orthopedic patients based on synthesized biomechanical features. This approach outperforms other traditional data augmentation approaches, opening a new direction to handle complex, rare occurrences in datasets for training complex deep learning models."

    "abstract": "For multiphase motor system driven by two-level multiphase voltage source inverter (VSI), the application of pulse width modulation (PWM) inevitably generates common-mode voltage (CMV), which induces electromagnetic interference (EMI) and causes bearing damage in the motor. In the case of odd-phase motor, CMV is mathematically impossible to eliminate. This paper proposes a generalized CMV suppression algorithm for odd-phase motor, based on carrier-based modulation (CBM) and pulse phase-shifting. The algorithm comprehensively addresses both the amplitude and switching frequency components of CMV, while incorporating a compensation method for dead-time effects in driving pulses to achieve common-mode voltage reduction (CMVR). The proposed CBM-CMVR algorithm suppresses the CMV amplitude to the minimum positive and negative peak values. Within one switching cycle, the CMV pulsates only twice or remains constant. Simulation results on a five-phase motor validate the effectiveness of the algorithm."

The matrix can shed light on future empirical investigations aimed at leveraging AI to mitigate the negative impacts of a lack of social and spatial connectedness among ICE dwellers, including deep-sea rig workers, cabin crews, mission control teams, astronauts, and commercial space tourists."

This obstruction, which has often restricted the performance of models previously formulated, has been resolved by the integration of causal understanding. The work we present here – is built upon the causal understanding represented in the form of Panoptic Segmentation. These representations provide us with much enriching object detection as each pixel, in this form, contains the detail of individual objects independent of the surroundings. Along with that, the inbuilt GPS system of CarLA simulator was combined with it to determine the location of our autonomous vehicle and path finding algorithms to optimize the path – our vehicle should take in order to reach the destination. After the modifications, we obtained the metrics of: RC as 99.87, IS as 8.0, and DS as 91.88 – in other words, the performance of system was significantly enhanced."

The system integrates a load cell and HX711 amplifier module for real-time weight detection, interfaced with an Arduino Nano that controls a peristaltic pump. When the measured force exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers a brief sugar water reward through a spout inside the behavioral chamber. To differentiate intentional responses from incidental movement, the setup includes both an active (rewarded) platform and a sham (non-rewarded) platform. All components are housed in a compact cylindrical enclosure with modular wiring, incorporating a relay module and DC–DC voltage converter for stable operation. Preliminary bench tests confirmed reliable force detection, rapid actuation, and consistent reward delivery. Originally developed and successfully presented as a senior Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduation project, the system is planned for future use in a neuroscience laboratory under development within the department. This open-source platform provides a reproducible, customizable, and cost-effective tool for operant conditioning tasks, with applications in spatial learning, decision-making, and motor behavior research in rodent models."

Two models, VGG16 and ResNet50, were evaluated on the WM811K dataset under fixed learning rate and CLR settings. A sensitivity analysis on the CLR step size was conducted to evaluate its impact on model performance. Three configurations were tested: small, moderate, and large step sizes. Testing results show that CLR outperformed fixed learning rates. ResNet50 with CLR achieved a testing accuracy of 98.30% while VGG16 with CLR, 95.03%. Overall improvements were also observed in precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Results suggest that CLR may accelerate CNN generalization for wafer defect classification."

Instead of relying on physical or technological constraints linked to the internal chip architecture, this paper takes an opposite point of view and tries to optimize these values to maximize application metrics such as the forward and round-trip read ranges. Thus, the provided method is actually independent from the technological or physical processes used during the chip design.

    "abstract": "Age classification using deep learning has gained significant attention due to its application in various fields. However, image classification models face challenges with noise and chaotic inputs, leading to a lack of robustness needed for consistent real-world performance. Various types of noise present in real-world images introduce confusion among classifiers. Therefore, this study focuses on establishing baseline accuracy for MobileNetV2 before introducing noise augmentation. In addition to testing noisy datasets, mixed datasets with both clean and noisy images are used to assess model robustness. To solve class imbalance, balanced datasets are generated with both uniform and unequal noise distributions. The results revealed that the model's accuracy decreased as noise levels increased, although balancing measures helped reduce the performance degradation and improve fairness across ages. While the clean dataset is normally the most accurate, in this experiment, the 50% noisy dataset had a slightly better accuracy (85.17%) than the clean dataset (84.94%). This minor improvement is most likely due to the regularization effect of moderate noise, which allowed the model to generalize more effectively to previously unseen data. Mixed datasets produced more robust findings where the uniform noise enhanced fairness across classes but reduced overall accuracy, whereas uneven noise increased accuracy for certain age groups but introduced classification bias."

A dual-label ensemble strategy is constructed to obtain the IDLRF algorithm on the proposed dual-label multi-classification decision tree algorithm. Finally, the IDLRF method is experimentally verified by using the traction motor data collected from the traction transmission system of high-speed trains.

Multi-user modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MU-MOCZ) is a non-coherent transmission scheme that supports multiple users without requiring explicit channel estimation, making it particularly suitable for such scenarios. This paper investigates an SNR-based dynamic modulation strategy for higher-order MU-MOCZ, inspired by adaptive modulation techniques in conventional cellular systems. In the proposed design, users are allocated different modulation orders based on their instantaneous SNR, with high-SNR users employing higher-order MOCZ to enhance throughput, while low-SNR users adopt lower-order MOCZ for improved detection reliability. Time-domain multiplexing with guard intervals is employed to mitigate inter-user interference in multipath channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SNR-based allocation achieves a favorable trade-off between spectral efficiency and reliability, significantly improving bit error rate and packet delivery ratio compared to fixed-order MU-MOCZ. These findings highlight the potential of dynamic higher-order MU-MOCZ to meet the stringent requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and heterogeneous multi-user short-packet applications in 6G and beyond networks."

Our results show that Isolation Forest achieves the best overall performance with a total score of 0.464 and superior computational efficiency of 0.339 seconds, detecting four collective anomalies with excellent temporal coherence. Surprisingly, the LSTM Autoencoder achieves only a 0.263 total score despite 206.444 seconds training time, challenging assumptions about deep learning superiority. These findings demonstrate that well-designed traditional methods can outperform complex deep learning approaches when considering computational efficiency and practical deployment requirements, providing essential guidance for building monitoring system design."

    "abstract": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation, enabling the protection of fragile quantum information from decoherence and noise. While classical Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes have been highly effective in digital communication systems, their direct application to quantum systems is inadequate mainly due to the no cloning theorem and the continuous nature of quantum errors. Unlike classical FECs, QEC is designed to detect and correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors without disturbing the encoded quantum state. This paper presents the code structure design and simulation of two quantum error correction codes—the Planar surface code and the 5-qubit Perfect code—using Qiskit and Stim on Google Colab. It is worth mentioning here that the performance of the Steane [ [7], [1], [3]] code is included in the current work as a benchmark. The codes are evaluated under statistical noise models, including amplitude damping and dephasing, which closely mirror the physical behavior of quantum hardware. The primary performance metric, for performance assessment, is the logical error rate, evaluated across a range of physical error rates and code distances under each noise model. The simulation results show that increasing the distance of the Planar code significantly reduces the logical error rates, demonstrating superior performance compared to other similar codes under this study."

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Accurate segmentation of infarcted myocardial regions from cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI) is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. Manual segmentation, though precise, is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. This study introduces a novel multi-stage deep learning framework based on DeepLabV3+ model for automatic myocardial scars detection. The framework employs three DeepLabV3+ models arranged in a multistage configuration, with each network independently segmenting the left ventricle (LV), cavity, myocardium and scar from MRI images. Two different DeepLabV3+’s backbones were investigated which are ResNet50 and MobileNetV2. A dataset of late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) images was obtained from Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), and used with expert-annotated ground truths for training and validation of the proposed framework. The proposed framework was also compared to a single-stage deep learning model that simultaneously segments MRI images into LV, cavity, myocardium and scar to benchmark its performance. Experimental results show that the framework demonstrated promising performance in segmenting infarct regions, measured by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), IoU and accuracy of each. The proposed framework achieved the dice similarity of 0.68486, IoU of 0.4849 and the accuracy 0.6133 respectively. The results support the potential of the proposed method in clinical workflows, offering fast, reliable, and reproducible segmentation."

    "abstract": "Multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) is potential to be extensively utilized in pulsed power system due to its high capacitance and high dielectric strength. However, there are still some unsolvable reliability problems in realistic operations, one of which is frequency-sensitive transient breakdown: a sudden failure occurring significantly below component’s designed expected lifespan. Some previous researches suggest that transient breakdown is related to the frequency of the pulsed electric field, but lacking experimental support. In this article, Laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is applied for detecting the vibrational behavior of MLCC when pulsed discharge, the result indicates that the pulsed electric field can activate MLCC to vibrate at specific frequencies and even stimulates resonant vibrations. Through both destructive and nondestructive analysis, we observed a decline of electrical breakdown strength and evidence of cracks within MLCC subjected to transient vibrations. These findings underscore the notion that transient breakdown is a compound electromechanical failure, occurring when a pulsed electric field at a specific frequency triggers transient vibrations within MLCC, these resonant vibrations impair the electrical breakdown strength of MLCC and finally result in transient breakdown."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of vehicular automation and communication technology, autonomous driving has emerged as a significant trend in future transportation. Robotaxis, an innovative mode of transportation that integrates robotics and artificial intelligence, are anticipated to become widely used, thereby revolutionizing urban mobility. This work proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming model for robotaxi dispatch. Unlike previous approaches, it can recommend passengers’ pick-up points, drop-off points, and boarding time (BT) that may deviate from their initial origins, destinations, and BT, respectively. It encourages passengers to accept the recommended pick-up and drop-off (UO) points or to be picked up slightly earlier or later. The objectives are to maximize the profit per kilometer of robotaxis and to minimize the total travel expense of passengers. Subsequently, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with mass center (NSGA-MC) is proposed to solve the model. It outperforms nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) across several metrics. Some instances provide detailed results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, comparing scenarios with and without UO-point and boarding-time recommendations. An experiment is also conducted to examine various recommendation acceptance rates, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model in developing intelligent public transportation systems."

Existing scheduling frameworks struggle to balance these demands under real-world conditions, especially as device movement and heterogeneous workloads increase system complexity. We present MOSAIC, a mobility-aware scheduling and resource management framework designed to optimize performance in dynamic IoT environments. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, a refined five-tier architecture extends the traditional edge-fog-cloud hierarchy by adding proximity, local, and regional mobility layers, enabling computation to follow mobile users more effectively and reducing unnecessary network traffic. Second, MOSAIC integrates a preemption-aware dynamic scheduler with an Adaptive-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lambda$</tex-math></inline-formula> reinforcement learning-based resource manager that adapts based on workload changes and mobility patterns, prioritizing energy-efficient edge execution while meeting strict deadlines. Third, the framework utilizes real-world mobility traces, including Levy-Walk, Random-Walk, and Geolife, to drive reconfiguration and improve decision accuracy. We evaluate MOSAIC through a large-scale deployment across three geographically distributed regions of the Grid'5000 testbed, using realistic workflows and mixed periodic/DAG task loads. Our results show that, compared to state-of-the-art schedulers, MOSAIC reduces energy consumption by 35.9%–×1.5, lowers latency by 42.8%–×4.9, and shortens makespan by 22.6%–×7.2, all while maintaining 100% deadline satisfaction across diverse mobility scenarios."

    "abstract": "Driving style refers to the behavioral preferences that drivers maintain during driving, shaped by their diverse experiences, habits, and needs, and is typically reflected in varying levels of aggressiveness. If humans choose to use autonomous driving systems, they would expect the driving style of the systems to closely resemble their own habit. However, this is challenging for current industrial autonomous driving systems. To address this, we developed a style controllable action generation method, STAGE, for driving tasks. Its training process is based on imitation learning, incorporating both style value and latent value action modality encoding. Preference learning is then used to identify the user's driving style as a continuous, monotonic style value. And to reduce the cost of human involvement in the preference training process, we also developed a set of rules to compare driving style in data pairs. Then, during inference, the user inputs the style value to control the generated action patterns, dynamically meeting the user's expectations. Using the STAGE method, we verified that the style-controlled action generation results in several typical road scenarios significantly align with human expectations. Furthermore, through comparisons between the STAGE method and various other approaches, we reveal the unique functionalities of STAGE, including its style controllability, style continuity, driving style alignment capability and driving safety.

    "abstract": "In many Radio Frequency Identification-based systems, Ultra-Wideband technology has emerged as a compelling alternative for improving positioning accuracy. Thanks to its high precision, low power consumption, and strong anti-interference capability, it shows broad application potential in complex environments. However, under non-line-of-sight conditions, the accuracy is considerably degraded due to signal obstruction and multipath interference. To address this challenge, an Ultra-Wideband signal classification method is proposed that leverages multi-level feature fusion and a cross-channel attention network. Initially, a feature selection mechanism utilizing recursive feature elimination with cross-validation is proposed to identify and retain the most salient Ultra-Wideband signal features, thereby mitigating the impact of irrelevant features and reducing computational complexity. Subsequently, to further enhance the model’s feature representation capability, a multi-level feature fusion module is introduced, which progressively integrates the outputs of each convolutional layer, consolidating features from multiple stages of the network. Concurrently, to further strengthen the proposed network’s ability to capture key features, a cross-channel attention mechanism is incorporated to adaptively assign weights based on feature importance. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved classification accuracies of 93.15%, 96.2%, and 98.49% on the three Ultra-Wideband datasets."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in electric vehicles and energy storage applications. However, conventional LIB is mainly composed of flammable liquid electrolytes, which has significant potential safety hazards and thermal runaway risks. Reducing the liquid electrolyte content helps to improve the intrinsic safety of batteries. A solid/liquid hybrid electrolyte lithium-ion battery (SLE-LIB) with less electrolyte (i.e., quasi-solid-state LIB) has been chosen as a transition from liquid electrolyte LIBs to all-solid-state LIBs, and it has achieved commercial application. Although electrochemical impedance is a powerful technique for condition monitoring and degradation analysis of batteries, the impedance model considering solid/liquid hybrid electrolytes has not yet been well established. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the impedance variation of a commercial SLE-LIB under different aging cycles, temperatures, and state-of-charge conditions. An equivalent circuit model (ECM) of the impedance spectrum is established to analyze its features further. The analysis results identify the available impedance features and corresponding internal changes in SLE-LIBs for condition monitoring, e.g., the imaginary-part impedance, ECM parameters for temperature monitoring. Furthermore, three case studies are introduced based on the obtained impedance feature parameters. The results illustrate that the estimation errors of temperature and health state are less than 4%, and the proposed impedance features can be used for degradation analysis. The research results can provide references for condition monitoring and degradation analysis of SLE-LIBs."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have expanded point cloud applications by point-based neural networks (PNNs). However, the escalating complexity and computational demands of PNNs overwhelm conventional computers. Specialized PNN accelerators have emerged, significantly outperforming modern CPUs and GPUs. Nevertheless, existing designs remain inefficient when handling performance-critical mapping kernels of PNNs, involving diverse arithmetic functions (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, add, multiply, sort) across separate hardware modules. This fragmentation restricts hardware sharing and data locality, leading to area overhead, redundant data movements, and under-utilization. Therefore, a unified and efficient micro-architecture for mapping kernels is needed to enhance performance and reduce data transfers. This paper presents APU, an efficient processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture for PNN acceleration. We introduce the first unified SRAM-PIM micro-architecture that supports all mapping kernels in mainstream PNNs. Data movement is reduced through extensive on-chip memory and maximized data locality via <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in-situ</i> computing approach. At the algorithmic level, we introduce mask grouping and aggregation to eliminate costly sorting operations, enabled by hardware support for in-memory vector max-search. This refined strategy reduces computational overhead and data transfers while improving inference accuracy.We further enhance performance by exploiting parallelism across PNN operations and applying mixed-precision quantization. Evaluated on real-world PNN workloads, APU outperforms the state-of-the-art accelerator by 2.54× in speedup and 4.54× in energy saving."

    "abstract": "In practice, firms' managers are key decision-makers and are often plagued by optimistic bias. In collaborative innovation, this optimism manifests in both alignment and divergence among parties, which affects the efficiency and stability of collaborative innovation. However, the conditions and mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To explore this issue, we consider a collaborative supply chain in which the supplier and the downstream manufacturer are realistic or optimistic. Our paper demonstrates the positive promotion of managerial optimism in innovation and shows that optimistic managers can innovate even when the profit in the supply chain is negative. Moreover, aligned optimism allows the supplier to shift the burden of innovation and cost to the manufacturer, increasing the manufacturer's innovation level. However, compared to aligned optimism, divergent optimism can lead to win-win outcomes under certain conditions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that when the optimism bias in consumer innovation preference is high, the supplier should choose a collaborator with an aligned attitude. Similarly, when the bias is moderate, the manufacturer should make the same choice. In both cases, aligned attitudes help synchronize decisions, which can benefit both firms due to higher innovation levels and reasonable prices."

It also gives a diagnostic tool to compare experimental BH lasers, using simple <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VI</i> measurements. In this experiment, 72 BH lasers with three different mesa top layer doping levels were measured. Then, a curve fit was performed on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VI</i> measurements using the proposed model, extracting the model parameters for each device. Nearly all the extracted model parameters, which were resistances and diode properties such as ideality factor and saturation current, had clear trends that help explain the impact of varying mesa top layer doping levels. The results showed, as discussed in previous literature, that high mesa top layer doping level reduces laser leakage current, but increases cavity loss. It was also found that by using only the fit on electrical characteristics, the model can roughly predict the measured drop in optical efficiency that the BH lasers experience at high input currents. The better understanding of leakage current that comes from this model can be used to further the development of BH lasers. As well, the model and curve fit can be used as a diagnostic tool to aid in the testing of these experimental devices."

    "abstract": "Bearing quantitative diagnosis is indispensable for the reliability assessment of rotating machinery, facilitating informed maintenance decisions. Existing research typically estimates bearing defect size using signal processing techniques or machine learning tools. However, these approaches rely on elaborate hand-crafted feature extraction or require extensive training data from various fault states, making them difficult to apply in practice. In this article, a novel digital twin-based defect size updating (DT-DSU) scheme is proposed to address these challenges. As a combination of simulation and virtual-reality interaction, digital twin (DT) technology provides a fresh perspective for bearing quantitative diagnosis. A modeling-calibration-updating strategy within the DT framework is adopted to enable unsupervised defect size estimation. First, DT-DSU constructs a DT prototype by embedding fine-grained defects into a simplified dynamic model of bearing. Time-frequency similarity calibration is conducted to obtain a high-fidelity DT model. Then, unlabeled vibration measurements are exploited to build the virtual-reality connection, enabling fault state updating of the DT model. The defect size is determined through the update process. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of DT-DSU are validated on two different bench tests."

Posture detection can be achieved through a simple and straightforward algorithm based on the error calculation between test data set and a reference one, encoded by the states of the tags. These states are represented by the normalized counting of tag EPC by a reader for a specific time duration. The algorithm selects the correct posture by identifying the test pattern with minimum error from the reference. The placement and quantity of RFID tags are optimized to balance system accuracy and complexity. The proposed method can reliably distinguish between different sitting postures achieving an accuracy of up to 90 - 94%.

    "abstract": "Assuming that neural networks can fit the dynamic characteristics of an unknown nonlinear system well, this paper develops a training method employing adaptive observer for single hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). Traditional SLFN training methods, such as the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, have limitations such as hyperparameter sensitivity and large iterative calculation volume. While the randomization method can improve efficiency, it lacks environmental adaptability. Inspired by the theory of adaptive observer for dynamic systems, this study first established the state space expression of SLFN and then designed an observer-based adaptive estimation mechanism. This mechanism estimates the parameters of the neural network and the values of hidden layer nodes online through input and output data, achieving the collaborative optimization of computational efficiency and generalization performance. Different from the conventional methods that require repeated training, the proposed algorithm can adapt to different operating environments and has significant advantages in time-varying systems such as battery monitoring and engine control. Finally, the effectiveness of this adaptive estimation mechanism applied to neural network training was verified through simulation experiments."

Leveraging multi-modal data sources — such as historical air pollution data, satellite data, weather, and socioeconomic factors — this project aims to predict real time and future air quality levels. Machine learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) will be applied to key pollutants such as NO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> and CO, to construct pollution forecasting trends and pinpoint areas of higher risk. Moreover, by taking the spatial and temporal variations in pollution levels into account, statistical and deep learning methods will be integrated into the system to further enhance prediction accuracy.The phenomenon study will assess these issues alongside the effects of air pollution on human health in general, with respiratory diseases as the overarching health indicator, as well as on all-cause mortality. By pin-pointing pollution hotspots, the project plans to alert affected populations in advance and propose possible interventions. Additionally, global forecasts will allow policymakers to design evidence-based policies for reducing the detrimental effects of air pollution. As socio-economic parameters will be induced, we will be able to explore the relationship of industrialisation, population density and urban development with pollution trends.This project aims to provide actionable insights for environmental agencies and urban planners through large-scale data analysis and predictive modelling. The results will contribute to the design of effective policies for pollution control, increase public awareness, and foster sustainable urban development. Overall, this study adds a more comprehensive and transcendental perspective of pollution, its development through time, as well as its definitive health and environmental impacts."

To overcome these difficulties, current work provides a low-cost industrial automation system based on the microcontroller family using programmable switching. The proposed system serves as a cost-effective alternative for sequential load switching to potentially lower the total sequential load switching cost in industrial applications where the cost of PLCs can add up to a significant amount. It provides 3 working modes — Set mode, Auto mode and Manual mode, which enable to carry out any repeated actions automatically and efficiently.

The primary contribution is the HR-AI Bridge Framework, a conceptual model structured around three core pillars: Strategic Application, Ethical Vigilance, and Human-Machine Collaboration. This model offers a structured approach for Moroccan universities to modernize their HRM curriculum.

For the purpose of mitigating privacy leakage while ensuring estimation performance, an optimal transmission scheduling strategy is proposed in this paper to counteract the challenges of steady-state trends and noise decay in stable CPS. Moreover, this strategy reduces the exposure risk of the acknowledgment (Ack) signal by leveraging pre-arranged indicators. The sensor can transmit either real state estimates or artificial noise to disrupt eavesdroppers. To satisfy privacy requirements, the expected error covariance of eavesdropper is maintained above that of legitimate estimator through minimizing a linear combination of both. Additionally, a belief vector is introduced to construct eavesdropper error covariance, accounting for not all eavesdropper information will be available. The optimal transmission scheduling is demonstrated to exhibit a threshold structure, which is supported by theoretical analysis. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis represents a significant skeletal disorder marked by diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and compromised micro architectural integrity, substantially elevating fracture susceptibility, especially among aging populations. This investigation introduces an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic framework that leverages deep neural networks to evaluate radiographic and DEXA imaging data. The architecture uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework learnt on curated medical image databases to distinguish normal and bone pattern of a diseased (osteoporotic) bone. The given technology solution can be characterized by a distributed web architecture that will integrate Flask-based analytical services, an interactive interface designed with React.js, and enable receiving instant diagnostic analysis. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning model for osteoporosis detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and additionally offering treatment and precaution recommendations and as a decision aids system meant to help the medical practitioners, this system provides an effective low-cost and scalable solution of initial osteoporosis assessments."

    "abstract": "Wind speed prediction in wind farms is often hindered by insufficient feature extraction and low prediction accuracy. To address these challenges and enhance both the accuracy and reliability of wind speed forecasts, a novel integrated prediction model is proposed, combining optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KAN). Initially, the maximum mutual information coefficient (MMIC) is selected as the fitness function, and the grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) is employed to globally optimize the modal decomposition layers and penalty factors of the VMD. The optimized VMD is then used to effectively decompose the raw wind speed data, followed by the reconstruction of the decomposed components. Finally, the dynamic feature selection mechanism of the KAN network is integrated with CNN and LSTM to construct a CNN-LSTM-KAN prediction model for wind speed forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the KAN network significantly improves the extraction of wind speed features, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of the model. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed approach are further validated through simulations using measured data from various wind farms."

The basis of traditional diagnostic methods is visual inspection, which usually results in poor accuracy. However, recent developments in machine learning (ML) have significantly improved disease diagnosis in a variety of health fields, including dermatology. This study examines the potential of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to improve the accuracy for prediction and to assist physicians in achieving more reliable conclusions with a data record with 1000 images of healthy hair to create a robust prediction system. This was created by web scraping and over 500 images were created that were affected by AA using DERMNET data records. Data records were further improved using preprocessing techniques such as data expansion, segmentation and image improvement. This analyzes numerous classifiers consisting of random forest classifiers, support vector machines (SVM),k-nearest network (KNN), and CNN to improve diagnostic accuracy with the accuracy rate are 89%, 90%, 83%, and 91.9% respectively. By using an ML-based classification algorithm it is better for identification alopecia areata, this work ultimately seeks to advance the diagnosis of bald prediction."

The research develops a Large Multimodal Approach for Intelligent Decision-Making in Manufacturing Transformation to resolve identified difficulties. The new framework unites DQN models with ERP and MES and PCS system data using sophisticated data fusion methods to present a modern manufacturing situation that maintains synchronized real-time control. A DQN model trained using historical production data generates optimal future decisions through its system while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) streamlines the data focus on essential features. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) makes strategic production goals part of decision-making processes and Model Predictive Control (MPC) allows instant modification of production parameters at runtime. Online Learning operates within the system to dynamically adapt production methods when facing changes in operating conditions. The proposed method outperforms Q-Learning, PPO, and standalone DQN according to performance tests through achieving cycle time of 96 along with maximum yield at 90% and a peak decision accuracy level of 90%. The research validates that this system stands above others in achieving optimal manufacturing infrastructure enhancement through real-time and adaptive intelligent decisions"

Additionally, to predict the aero-engine performance degradation under both single and variable working conditions, comparative experiments are designed by using the CBRB model and other models. The findings confirm the practical utility of the CBRB model, demonstrating its superior forecasting accuracy compared to other models."

    "abstract": "In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator’s wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot’s arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments."

    "abstract": "Contrast subspace mining is the process of finding contrast subspaces in a dataset where a given query object is most similar to a target class but most different to other class. A contrast subspace typically consists of one or more features derived from the original feature set of the dataset. The obtained contrast subspace is mainly used to gain insight about the query object and thus, provide information to perform further analysis for better decision making on certain tasks. Contrast subspace mining using tree technique has shown the capability to mine contrast subspace for a query object in a categorical dataset. However, the optimization of the contrast subspace search process has not yet been explored to find contrast subspace globally. This research proposes an optimized contrast subspace search by applying genetic algorithm, called TB-CSMinerGC, to discover contrast subspace on data consisting categorical features. The likelihood contrast scoring function based on tree technique is used as a fitness function to select the contrast subspace with the most potential for a query object for evolution in order to avoid being trapped in a local optima search space. The experiment results show that the optimized method managed to determine the contrast subspaces of a query object in four real world categorical datasets and outperform the existing method in 10 out of 16 cases."

The results show that Harris provides a promising performance by exceeding the target accuracies for both training and testing set by ReLU at some of the α-values and using the F1-score it exceeds ReLU in the image classification for most of the CIFAR-10 classes."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a virtual sensor modeling method based on maximal information coefficient (MIC) and sample interval attention-based long short-term memory (SIA-LSTM). First of all, MIC is employed to identify process variables that exhibit a strong correlation with the target variable. Subsequently, SIA-LSTM introduced an attention mechanism to adaptively estimate varying sampling intervals is utilized to model the virtual sensors for supply and return water temperatures in the chiller unit of the HVAC system. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated and verified on an actual HVAC system."

    "abstract": "Indoor poultry farms rely on inspection robots to sustain precise environmental control, a factor essential for limiting rapid disease transmission and large-scale bird losses. Yet the challenging conditions inside these facilities—marked by harsh lighting contrasts and frequent water accumulation—introduce major obstacles. Conventional navigation strategies that depend on a single sensor often struggle in such settings, leading to problems like laser drift and errors in visual guide-line extraction. To address these issues, we introduce a new hybrid navigation approach that combines laser and vision sensing. This method dynamically calculates a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensing modality, thereby removing the need for physical navigation lines. Tests conducted in operational poultry houses show that our approach not only mitigates the fundamental weaknesses of single-sensor systems but also substantially improves navigation accuracy and overall efficiency. Consequently, it offers a promising pathway for enhancing inspection robot performance in complex indoor poultry farming environments."

We first created a baseline CNN to establish a basic accuracy, subsequently fine-tuning the chosen DCNNs to enhance performance. By methodically adjusting the layer settings, we achieved significant improvements, leading to our ensemble model achieving a validation accuracy of 97.56%, which significantly outperformed individual models. The results show that fine-tuning can improve the accuracy and generalizability of DCNNs for classifying skin lesions. This shows that ensemble techniques with careful calibration can help doctors make better diagnoses in clinical settings."

This paper introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system in which the TabNet deep learning algorithm will be incorporated with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) as a means to provide an accurate and explainable ad recommendation. TabNet is applied to measure non-linear interactions between features in structured ad campaign data, whereas SHAP is applied to explain the output of the model in terms of individual input features to give coherent, comprehensive explanations. The presented system is trained and tested on real-world user advertisements dataset including user behavioural interactions and demographic features and sentiment-based TF-IDF features. SMOTE process is being used in training to balance data imbalance of conversion labels. On experimental performance, it shows good performance, with the AUC of 0.91 and Fl score of 0.79. SHAP-based analysis helps display the top characteristics of conversion, e.g., the length of engagement and sentiments indicators. Moreover, the framework provides the instance-level explanation, which allows any of the recommendations to be traced and interpreted. Such a level of predictive accuracy and explainability renders the model quite well-suited to deploy transparently and in an ethical manner in commercial systems used to target ads."

    "abstract": "Lung diseases are among the most important health issues that need to be addressed in the healthcare sector. Early detection of the disease and prompt treatment significantly reduce its progression. In the rapidly advancing field of healthcare, disease images play a crucial role in detecting lung diseases. In this study, YOLO models were used to analyse and accurately classify lung disease images. The study analysed lung disease images consisting of three classes—virus, bacteria, and normal images—in YOLO models to accurately and quickly detect the disease. In the experiments, YOLOv8 achieved 87.9%, YOLOv9 achieved 85%, YOLOv10 achieved 86.8%, YOLOv11 achieved 87.8%, and YOLOv12 achieved 86.1% average precision (mAP). In this study, YOLOv8 demonstrated the best performance compared to other models due to its ability to generalise object detection, thanks to its model architecture and feature extraction. This study makes significant contributions to deep learning-based medical imaging systems in terms of both accuracy and reliability."

    "abstract": "An industrial park in China has adopted Building Integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology, integrating solar power generation products into steel structure workshops. The resulting pollution from photovoltaic panels has significantly reduced the power generation efficiency. Therefore, effective detection and cleaning strategies are imperative. In recent years, breakthroughs in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence technologies have enabled UAVs to achieve precise pollution monitoring and formulate optimized cleaning strategies, providing new solutions for the cleaning of photovoltaic panels. This study explores the optimization of visual pollution detection and intelligent cleaning strategies based on unmanned aerial vehicles. Use UAVs to enter the photovoltaic panel array at a specific height and path to collect infrared video streams for color space conversion. Artificial intelligence is used to detect images to identify common defects in photovoltaic panels and guide cleaning robots to formulate effective cleaning strategies. In 2025, experimental flights were conducted using UAVs under various weather conditions, and the following conclusions were drawn. Firstly, the strategies of UAVs and cleaning robots depend on the weather, and the detection effect is best in clear and cloudy conditions. Secondly, a dynamic cleaning strategy must be adopted, that is, the degree of cleaning varies in different weather conditions. Thirdly, in future applications, all-weather sensor fusion and multi-robot collaboration must be employed to achieve a cleaning efficiency higher than 95%."

    "abstract": "Affective state is a key factor affecting the music preference and the user experience. Traditional music recommendation systems do not have the capability of emotional sense, and the recommendations may then be contradictory to the user who wants to listen to music in a certain mood. This paper introduces a real-time Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system, which employs a hybrid model of a CNN and a BiLSTM to recognize the user's emotions from speech input. The model is trained on public available databases--CREMA-D, and RAVDESS--and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features with 50 dimensions are used. The system is tailored for mobile implementation with TensorFlow Lite and packaged in a native Android app. Emotion recognition outcome plays emotion-based music according to a pre-stored play-list. The performance of the system is tested under different real-world scenarios ranging from noisy to silent conditions. User testing has shown that users can decern between positive, neutral and negative emotions. In addition, the mobile app possessed good usability and learned user satisfaction, which further implied that it had the possibility to be used to facilitate emotion efficiently using personalized music experiences."

Two integration rules (AND and OR) were evaluated under a fixed false alarm rate constraint. The system was tested using a passive radar demonstrator in a real-world scenario involving low-altitude drone detection. Results show that multi-frequency integration enhances detection capability.

Building on previous work, we reproduce and extend LSTM-based AMC models using the CSPB.ML.2018 dataset, introducing an alternative input shape that inverts the roles of time steps and features. This approach reduces training time by over 90% compared to conventional LSTMs and improves classification accuracy by up to 13.4% when using IQ inputs, particularly at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). However, it requires longer input signal samples to match the performance of conventional models at high SNRs. We evaluate both cartesian (IQ) and polar input representations, demonstrating that IQ inputs consistently outperform polar inputs across all models. Our results highlight the trade-offs between computational efficiency, input length, and classification accuracy, offering insights for optimizing AMC systems in resource-constrained and real-time applications, such as cognitive radio and spectrum monitoring."

The early and accurate detection of conditions serves double purposes by aiding proper diagnosis and effective treatment methods. This paper presents an ensemble learning strategy based on stacking to forecast breast cancer outcomes using data from the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. First the data undergoes two preprocessing stages that include SMOTE to remedy class unbalance and SelectKBest to select the top 20 features. StandardScaler is employed for normalization. The proposed model utilizes Logistic Regression as the meta-classifier in stacking while base classifiers include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The developed model delivered superior performance through its 0.9737 accuracy rate along with 0.9722 precision, 0.9859 recall and 0.9790 F1-score as well as 0.9697 AUC-ROC. The experimental results indicate that the developed ensemble methodology provides highly effective automatic classification of breast cancer."

Instead of directly optimizing QoS or QoE metrics, the proposed method employs phase-based target buffer values (100 KB and 1000 KB) as the objective of the fitness function, allowing ABC to guide the buffer adjustment process in synchronization with handover dynamics. This approach enables timely buffer resizing to reduce packet loss during unstable phases while maximizing throughput and video stability in steady states. Experimental results using Mininet-WiFi show that ABC achieves significant improvements in delay, packet loss, PSNR, and SSIM compared to PSO and DE, particularly in high-mobility scenarios with frequent handovers."

The study investigates how key geometrical parameters mainly the tag-tometal gap, metal thickness and the overall size of the metallic structure are able to affect critical antenna performance metrics such as resonant frequency (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$f_{r}$</tex>), bandwidth (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$B W$</tex>), gain and radiation efficiency (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R E$</tex>). A printed dipole RFID tag antenna, optimized for UHF operation at 915 MHz, is modeled and analyzed using ANSYS-HFSS. Through a systematic parametric study, the results reveal that the metal structure is highly affecting the RFID tag antenna characteristics and that taking into account this environment from the first design phase is crucial for optimal performance. These findings not only provide valuable insights into the reliable deployment of RFID systems in metallic environments but also pave the way for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models to forecast the impact of metallic surroundings and predict best spatial alignment of the antenna. This predictive capability would greatly enhance the design process and enable optimized tag placement strategies in real-life RFID applications."

    "abstract": "Inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) faults are among the most critical internal faults in power transformers, often causing severe equipment degradation and economic loss if not detected in time. However, traditional detection methods based on terminal electrical parameters lack sensitivity to early-stage or mild ITSCs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel ITSC fault localization method based on abnormal leakage magnetic field tracing. An electromagnetic field coupling model is first established to analyze the spatial redistribution of leakage flux caused by shorted turns. The resulting magnetic anomaly is then formulated as an inverse problem, in which the fault location and severity are reconstructed by minimizing the discrepancy between simulated and observed flux distributions. A two-dimensional particle swarm optimization (TD-PSO) algorithm is introduced to solve this inverse problem, offering efficient convergence and high localization accuracy. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average localization error of 4.18% in simulation and 9 mm in experimental validation. Compared to conventional methods, it exhibits superior performance in sensitivity and robustness, especially under weak fault conditions. This study provides a physics-informed, optimization-driven framework for accurate and timely localization of ITSC faults, offering new insights for transformer condition monitoring and predictive maintenance."

Hybrid systematics are discussed in this paper, wherein hardware parts are merged with relevant software commands to ultimately produce an efficient gesture recognition model. The model has been proven in this paper using the combination of OpenCV and MPU6050 to increase the level of accuracy. This enhances the overall interactions offered by the user while carrying out day-to-day activities with ease. Thus, this suggested model optimizes performance and improves accuracy."

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are within the most common and severely impact cardiovascular morbidity, so timely and accurate diagnosis is needed. In order to detect arrhythmias, this paper proposes a brand-new multi-modal deep learning framework. Its process utilizes both PPG signals and ECG signals. PPG allows optical monitors that are simple for use as well as monitoring may be nearly continuously done. ECG gives precise electrical activity though. Attention mechanisms plus CNNs allow the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns within the two signals. What is detected then gets strengthened by fusion. Features are extracted by ECG as well as PPG-specific CNN branches plus inter-modal dependencies get integrated by a transformer-based fusion module then arrhythmia is diagnosed by one classification head. Ablation studies can show multi-modal fusion matters especially in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias, where PPG complements ECG during motion. The real-time monitoring system is optimized and it is designed for being worn. The system's light weight makes body wear easier so monitoring in real time is possible. This paper advances the area of arrhythmia diagnosis since it consolidates information coming from ECG and PPG and since it incorporates Independent Component Analysis (ICA) so as to improve detection. Also, after consolidating of the ECG and PPG information, ICA diagnoses arrhythmia, and it can be applicable to the analysis for use in the clinic and for daily use. Enhancements might include edge-computing optimization and expansion. These enhancements may apply also to the rarer arrhythmia subtypes."

    "abstract": "Strong technology platforms are needed to track, analyze and display data about migrants now and in previous years throughout areas and regions. The approach presented here is based on using specific techniques to construct and support a database using GIS for monitoring patterns in migrant population movements. The major approach is to organize the information in multiple layers supported by PostgreSQL and PostGIS, so the system can store and search for geospatial and temporal features. Spatiotemporal modelling is used to track migration over time based on temporal logic which supports analysing and forecasting movement. We use information from the government census, mobile networks and special surveys and feed this data to an automated ETL pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of Python, along with GDAL/OGR spatial tools, for data cleanup, standardization and the creation of a single schema. Performance is improved by using R-tree for space and B-tree for time indexing methods for efficient access to a broad range of data. An animated web interface created using Leaflet.js and D3.js makes it possible to see changes in migration, population and geographic patterns. The data processing system is registered in city traffic scenarios to see how effectively it can supply timely, meaningful details for policy-makers and planners. The system is shown to assist in informed making decisions because of its accurate analysis of time and place. It gives institutions and governments a way to enhance resources for monitoring migrants and creating plans, all with the help of advanced GIS technologies."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on an n-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hydraulic manipulator operating in three-dimensional (3-D) space. Given that inaccurate modeling and disturbances pose difficulties for system control performance, a controller is designed based on the robust integral of sign error (RISE) approach with its parameters tuned using an adaptive method. A novel dual extended state observer (DESO) is employed to estimate and compensate for disturbances arising from both matched and mismatched uncertainties. Experiments are conducted on a multi-DOF experimental platform. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed controller effectively enhances joint tracking performance of the multi-DOF hydraulic manipulator. Specifically, on average, the control system's tracking accuracy for command signals is 47.02% higher than that achieved with RISE, 51.51% higher than that achieved with feedback linearization controller (FLC), and 69.66% higher than that achieved with proportional-integral (PI) control."

The proposed WPT system employs helical coils for both the transmitter and receiver (RX), achieving a high coupling coefficient exceeding 0.5 across a substantial RX movement range. To mitigate the complexity of the system due to RX movement, an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-uniform resonator with unequal turn spacing was developed using a genetic algorithm based on theoretical analysis. While the RX was moving, the proposed <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-uniform resonator reduced the receiving-side voltage and current variations to 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively. This represents a significant improvement over the 34.1% and 37.0% observed in conventional coil designs with equal turn spacing. Additionally, the proposed system maintained a total system efficiency above 85% over the entire RX movement range, demonstrating its suitability for dynamic WPT applications without the need for RX position detection systems. In conclusion, the proposed resonator overcomes the tangling and reliability issues of traditional power cables, enabling flexible seat movement in future autonomous vehicles to optimize their interior space."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence has spurred the development of specialized deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Among them, computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures are promising for their in-situ computation capability, which alleviates the computation and data movement bottlenecks of modern DNNs. However, the diversity of models and hardware designs makes it challenging to fully exploit CIM accelerators. Existing approaches often rely on manual mapping or provide limited automation, struggling to integrate general-purpose optimizations with CIM-specific features. In this work, we present HARMONY, a hardware-aware compilation framework for CIM accelerators. At its core is a hardware intermediate representation (IR) that unifies computational and memory abstractions. Based on this IR, HARMONY introduces an automatic mapping algorithm that identifies offloadable operators and constructs a hybrid software–hardware IR. This enables systematic integration of general-purpose and CIM-specific scheduling primitives within a unified search space, which is efficiently explored using reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive evaluations show that HARMONY supports a broader set of operators than existing CIM compilers and consistently delivers substantial performance and energy improvements across diverse DNN workloads. These results demonstrate that HARMONY provides both generality and efficiency, making it a practical compilation solution for CIM accelerators."

    "abstract": "The vehicle to everything (V2X) serves as a crucial foundation for future intelligent transportation systems. Security concerns within the V2X have garnered significant attention and key generation from wireless channels have emerged as a promising technique. However, applying key generation to V2X is quite challenging because the fast moving vehicles result in very small coherence time and impact channel measurements correlation. This paper designed a practical V2X key generation by enhancing channel state information (CSI) reciprocity and carried out extensive experimental evaluation. In particular, the designed key generation consists of channel probing, CSI preprocessing, CSI compensation and key establishment. In the channel probing, we deliberately reduced the time delay between uplink and downlink transmissions, to allow almost simultaneous measurements. We then carefully designed CSI preprocessing to remove hardware carrier leakage and eliminate noise effects. Furthermore, we devised CSI compensation by using interpolation or deep learning prediction to further improve the reciprocity. Finally, key establishment converted the measured CSI into binary sequences and reconcile on a common key via low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. We adopted universal software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 platforms for channel measurements and implemented the above algorithms. We carried out extensive experiments in real-road environments with various vehicle speeds. These carefully designed algorithms enabled our system working robustly even in high mobility scenarios, e.g., 40 km/h. Experimental results demonstrated common and random key can be generated with a key block error rate (BER) less than 0.1."

    "abstract": "Swarmalator studies have enabled self-organized collective behaviors that emerge from dual spatial and temporal coupling, without relying on external inputs. These behaviors arise solely from attractive and repulsive interactions modulated by a few global parameters. Here, we treat the swarmalator model as a planner and study how several of the collective behaviors change in terms of space-phase organization when the agents are robots with vehicle dynamics and constraints: including omnidirectional, unicycle, and bicycle dynamics. Furthermore, we use the control barrier function method to guarantee that the collective can navigate around objects, through cluttered environments, and transport objects in between obstacles by exploiting global and local control methods. This work brings us closer to realizing large groups of robotic swarmalators, of heterogeneous dynamics, that can enable shape formation, navigation, and object manipulation in cluttered environments."

    "abstract": "In marine environment investigation and target detection, the deployment scheme for multiple detection nodes directly determines the coverage and information acquisition effectiveness of the detection area. The existing research faces three problems: (1) the dilemma of the Pareto suboptimal trade-offs in multi-objective optimizations; (2) the insufficient convergence reliability of swarm intelligence algorithms; (3) physical modeling distortion in virtual force algorithms. To improve the coverage rate of detection area in multi-sensor systems, we propose an optimization method for the deployment strategy of multiple detection nodes based on improved grey wolf algorithm and virtual force strategy (namely IVF-CLGWO). Specifically, we propose a method to derive the minimum number of required sensors in the target area based on radius of the equivalent circle for sensor node sensing range, which transforms the multi-objective deployment optimization problem into a single objective one; Then, we improve the basic grey wolf optimization algorithm based on cosine convergence factor and Levy flight strategy (CLGWO) to improve the global search and local exploration capabilities of the algorithm; Finally, inspired by Coulomb’s law, we improve the virtual force algorithm (IVF) by optimizing the force equation of the sensor node and design an adaptive adjustment strategy for the maximum movement step size of the node. The numerical simulation results verified the reliability and stability of the proposed IVF-CLGWO algorithm, and combined with algorithm complexity analysis, sensitivity testing and ablation study, fully validated its comprehensive advantages. Compared with the benchmark method, in the fully-passive working mode, the optimal coverage rate of detection area increases by about 5% to 19.5%, and in the multi-base working mode, the optimal coverage rate of detection area increases by about 2% to 16.5%."

Second-order sliding mode control with double integrated sliding surfaces (DSSMC) increase HTHG frequency regulation, tie-line power management, and reliability. Asymptotic stability and dependability of HTHG are improved by this strategy, which also minimizes chattering in first order sliding mode control (SMC). The complete HTHG stabilization is examined employing Lyapunov's stability-based linear matrix inequality (LMI). A two-area thermal-hydropower system (TATHS) is used to test the LFC technique's efficacy. The suggested DSSMC scheme exhibits strong robustness in the face of parameter uncertainties and load disturbances (LDs) from the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. Compared to alternative techniques with less uncertainty tolerance, it greatly improves HTHG overall reliability, tie-line power coordination, and frequency regulation. The outcomes by MATLAB/SIMULINK validate this method's potential as a reliable remedy for power system stability and LFC in HTHG settings."

An AI early warning system using deep learning has been presented to detect underwater missiles quickly and automatically from sonar data. We create a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model for the goal of identifying and following missile traces in noisy underwater conditions. We use readings from many distributed sonars to improve how effective our sonar detection systems are. When experiments are done using a dataset of underwater missile signatures, the system correctly identifies the signatures 96.5% of the time and keeps the false alarms below 1.8%. Compared to traditional signal processing, today’s methods can find signals farther away by about 25%.

The mechanical model was designed in SolidWorks, exported as STL, and converted to FBX format in Blender. Coordinate frames were assigned to each joint, and forward kinematics was derived using the coordinate-frame composition method. Matlab was employed to compute the homogeneous transformation matrix, and the kinematic model was validated through motion and reachability tests in RoboDK as well as by comparing Unity-computed end-effector positions with Matlab results, showing millimeter-level agreement. The verified model was imported into Unity, where pivot points were assigned and an interactive interface with sliders, text fields, and input boxes was developed. Custom C# scripts enabled joint-level control, real-time end-effector computation, smooth homing motions, and free-scene camera navigation. Unlike previous studies focusing solely on Matlab-based simulation or Unity-based visualization, this work integrates both environments into a unified platform. The proposed approach provides a reproducible testbed for trajectory planning, motion control, and educational demonstrations, offering a safe, cost-effective, and extensible environment for industrial robotics research."

    "abstract": "The weaving of bamboo and willow is the important part of traditional craft heritage, a complicated craft of wonders of manual work and cultural significance. The paper is a human–AI collaborative system to design weave pattern with interaction between human and AI through Procedural generation of the weave patterns by L-System modelling and Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGAs) so that the design can be more authentic to their cultural use and adapted to the present product design. Such patterns that are applied in the constructions made of bamboo and willows also exploit the recursive structure and geometrical restrictions found in woven systems, which are codified in the logic rules of the L-System and used to produce systematically scalable and rule-based variants of patterns. At the same time, IGAs were also used to include live feedback of artisan weavers and designers on the pattern in order to continuously improve them on the basis of aesthetic, functional, and cultural requirements. The current weaving designs are used in various cultural products like furniture, lamps and decorations among other products and this way the continuity of heritage is maintained by embracing practical innovations. This framework will prove that adding algorithmic pattern generation to human aesthetics judgement is a viable direction to move heritage weaving towards through an enhanced cultural product design using digitally enhanced manufacturing processes."

    "abstract": "In order to solve the problem of system failure and large-scale power outage caused by transient instability of power system, this paper proposes a dominant instability mode (DIM) identification model of power system based on Multi-feature Fusion (MFF). Firstly, the Laida criterion was used to preprocess the raw data to effectively identify and eliminate noise interference. Secondly, the residual bottleneck structure is introduced into the Deep Residual Memory Network (DRMN) to greatly reduce the computational complexity, and the bidirectional dependencies in the power system time series data are fully captured by combining bidirectional learning. In addition, the Tanh-Sigmoid hybrid activation function is introduced, and its nonlinear characteristics significantly enhance the expressive ability of the model. Finally, the cross-attention mechanism is used to dynamically allocate the weights of amplitude and phase angle features, which realizes the efficient fusion of multi-source features and the accurate capture of interactive information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.18% in conventional tests and 95.50% under 5 dB noise conditions.. Compared with other models, the proposed model shows stronger effectiveness and anti-noise ability in the recognition of DIM in power system."

It is very important to detect and classify Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) to provide fast and appropriate treatment. This works proposes a new framework called Custom Meta Classifier (CMC) by using various hybrid deep learning structures to increase accuracy in detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). We take an innovative method of using ResNet-50, Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16), and EfficientNet-B4 and merging their features by means of dynamic fusion and attention strategies. The proposed Custom Meta Classifier (CMC) makes use of adaptive weighting and cross-attention to make full use of each model’s special strengths. Evaluating APTOS 2019 with images that are 224×224 pixels uncovers that APTOS achieves 94.8% accuracy, 93.5% sensitivity, and 96.1% specificity. The meta-classifier consistently performs well with every severity of diabetic retinopathy."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) using aircraft kinematics. The proposed estimator relies on an approximate linear time-varying kinematic model, and utilizes measurements from the GPS, inertial measurement unit, and pitot tube. Although the entire state vector is shown to be unobservable in the presence of a constant flight attitude, we perform a novel analysis on observability degree by evaluating the angle between the direction vector of each state variable and the observable subspace, and reveal that both AOA and AOS have a high observability degree as long as the airspeed is sufficiently large. To address the ill-conditioned problem associated with the above non-uniform observability condition, a reduced-order Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF) based method is proposed to estimate only the strongly observable AOA and AOS in the state vector. The unobservable wind components are not explicitly estimated, but their influences are still considered for updating the covariance matrices and the filter gain. Using real cruise flight data of a large civil aircraft, the proposed SKF based method is demonstrated to have about 40% reduction in root mean square error in comparison with using the standard Kalman filter under the non-uniform observability condition."

In this work, a machine learning based method for forward prediction and inverse design of microstrip patch antennas has been introduced, which focuses on the reflection coefficient (S11). A vast dataset generated through HFSS(High Frequency simulation software) simulations is used to train XGBoost regression models. The forward model estimates S11 from geometric parameters and frequency, and a reverse model along with numerical optimization predicts the design parameters required to meet a target S11. The forward model shows highly accurate result with minimal RMSE and accurately predicting S11 based on design inputs. The reverse model, although revealing good trends, proves to have limitations in precision. For example, the resultant predicted S11 was -11.81 dB for target of an S11 of -5 dB at 2.4 GHz, revealing an overestimation that demonstrates the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem. These results indicate that although machine learning is promising for antenna design automation, refinement in inverse modeling is required to achieve stable target attainment. This can be achieved through more robust model structures and improved optimization methods."

The proposed approach integrates diffusion policies with conditional diffusion processes and a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to improve trajectory-following accuracy. It generates 6-DoF action sequences from an initial noise distribution via a diffusion policy, refining them with a MINE. This enables learning of complex, nonlinear features in high-dimensional configuration spaces while optimizing the gradient field of an energy-based model for smooth and continuous motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances accuracy, allowing the use of smaller models without performance loss. These advancements create new opportunities for efficient and adaptive robotic control in real-world applications."

In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a novel integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) framework that uses a monostatic backscatter system for device-free indoor user localization. In contrast to most existing ISAC-related works in the literature, we consider energy harvesting backscattering tags as communication users, and our sensing application is non-intrusive, where we localise the target without tagging it. Specifically, we utilize Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) tags and a machine learning model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately estimate user positions within a defined sensing region. Through experiments conducted with off-the-shelf hardware, we systematically evaluate the influence of different numbers of tags, transmission power, and spatial resolution on localization accuracy and system through-put. Overall, our novel experimental demonstration indicates that the proposed ISABC framework achieves a localization accuracy that exceeds 90 % without a significant degradation in backscatter communication performance, highlighting its potential as a low-power and sustainable solution for next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) applications."

A commercially available UHF RFID tag IC compatible with EPC C1G2 was used for this study. Theoretical investigations show that both energy and communication range can be increased by a factor of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sqrt{2}$</tex> or about 41% through the use of two antennas in the transponder without reducing the transponder's read angle. Practically, a constructed C1G2-compatible transponder achieved an increase of approximately 15% in energy range and 19% in communication range. The presented technique is not limited to two antennas and can help to extend the range of RFID systems without modifications to the reader. This could especially be interesting for applications within the Ambient IoT (A-IoT) of 6G networks."

Instead of relying on traditional handcrafted models and statistical assumptions, the proposed framework learns the underlying channel characteristics directly from data, enabling more adaptive and robust estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial reductions in normalized mean-square error (NMSE) compared to conventional estimators such as least squares (LS), and further exhibits improved performance over advanced methods, particularly across both low and high SNR regimes.

Accurate and early diagnosis is an important factor that plays a valuable role in creating effective treatment strategies. The study addressed four types of brain tumors: pituitary, meningioma, glioma and no tumor. Initially, a custom CNN model was developed, yielding validation and test accuracies of 65% and 54%, respectively, which indicate limited classification performance. Subsequently, the EfficientNetB0 model was employed through a transfer learning approach, achieving substantially higher validation accuracy (0.96), test accuracy (0.97), and improved generalization capability. The findings clearly demonstrate that EfficientNetB0 surpasses the custom CNN model in brain tumor classification performance.

However, only stationary components are used for nonstationary monitoring in most of SSA-based methods. Nonstationary components are difficult to monitor because anomalies can be easily masked by trend variations. In this paper, a nonstationary process monitoring method from a space perspective is proposed based on the analytic SSA (ASSA) method. Different from conventional methods, nonstationary components are monitored by constructing a principal angle-based statistic. The corresponding subspace of nonstationary components is invariant in the fault-free case. Motivated by this, anomalies can be monitored by comparing the variation between offline and online nonstationary subspaces. The advantages of the ASSA-based monitoring method are demonstrated on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process."

    "abstract": "The tunnel diode is a mature device that has recently received new attention for low-powered electronics due to its extraordinarily low zero-bias responsivity. One of the practical challenges with using these discrete devices is measuring the current-voltage (I-V) behavior due to selfoscillation. Although this oscillation may be damped through manual tuning at various biases, the tunnel diode I-V data is typically incomplete or poorly sampled. In this work, we discuss the nuances of picoammeters and testing tunnel diodes. Furthermore, measured data from a commercially available tunnel diode is presented with two methods to automatically create a SPICE model for the device when I-V data is incomplete."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to design multi-port circularly polarized (CP) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with wideband, high-gain, and compact characteristics. The proposed approach is a combination of dual-polarized CP radiating elements and hybrid couplers. The design concept is validated by using four dual-CP radiators and four hybrid couplers for 8-port MIMO array realization. Here, the use of hybrid couplers can excite both elements simultaneously, leading to high gain radiation. Besides, using dual-CP radiators helps to reduce the required radiating elements, resulting in a compact form factor. Simulations of the 8-port antenna with compact overall dimensions of 2.16λ×0.83λ×0.06λ demonstrate a wide operating bandwidth of 14.8% (5.0–5.8GHz). Across this band, the inter-port isolation is always better than 10 dB and the maximum gain of 9.0 dBi is achieved."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high-quality labeled data significantly degrades the generalizability of deep learning models, particularly in scenarios with diverse and challenging imaging conditions, such as road scenes under heterogeneous environmental variability. This paper investigates key challenges in understanding the context of the road and proposes a hybrid data augmentation strategy to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation in adverse weather conditions, eliminating the dependency on additional annotated datasets. Experiments were conducted on the street dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method. To further assess its efficacy, comparative experiments were performed using three semantic segmentation architectures: Attention-Unet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+. The results demonstrate improved performance compared to conventional augmentation methods across both real-world and synthetic datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses some recent developments in collaborative healthcare research considering settings where human clinicians collaborate through or interact with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled systems to enhance clinical diagnosis, treatment procedures, and decision-making practices. Through a detailed examination of the potential gaps, implications, and challenges for health professionals and patients, this work explores typical AI-based collaborative clinical workflows and infrastructures that involve tasks such as patient data analysis, medical imaging, and event prediction. A brief synopsis of published research reveals inherent sociotechnical barriers concerning interoperability, data scarcity, bias amplification, trust, and transparency. It also highlights risks related to inadequate model and interface design, the oversimplification of clinical processes (e.g., lack of shared situational awareness), institutional misalignment (e.g., cultural norms and practices shaping how clinicians coordinate their efforts and make decisions based on AI recommendations), and commercial data manipulation that threatens patient care."

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems play a critical role in the early planning stages of health management and prognostics to ensure reliable and efficient operation in space missions. Presently, there are several technical obstacles that might prevent the use of autonomous robotic drilling along with sampling on the moon. To ensure the successful and reliable operation of regolith sampling missions, it is necessary to study robotic self-adaptive drilling methods on the moon's surface. Previous work by the authors has connected ground drilling sample data with mechanical-soil interaction processes, investigated how lunar soil affects core drilling and load fluctuation states, and more. Afterwards, they offered a plausible assessment of the lunar soil sequence's condition during the drilling phase. The residual useful life (RUL) is predicted using the reliability-adaptive systems technique to avoid maintenance conflicts. In the proposed research, a lunar surface having many systems, such as one base and six rovers, is shown. The rovers drill into the moon's surface to bring back soil samples to Earth. While the lunar materials manufacturing facility is located within a level area, the rovers' duty is to collect dirt or rocks from areas surrounding small obstacles put on the edge of the flat surface. The best way to determine RUL is to monitor the drill's wear. When determining the drill failure rate, a lot of random variables are considered. Some examples of these include radiation, soil temperature relative to the rover, and soil density. Entire Assistance This study introduces a method for predicting drilling forces using machine learning. This study improves control settings and uses a novel method for real-time force forecasting to deliver intelligent lunar drilling that is both safe and efficient. Both the penetrating force and the spinning torque may be precisely predicted by the system. The study also reveals the spatial and temporal relationships between the different drilling state variables. The results of the case study demonstrate that (1) the proposed method of fusing spatiotemporal features has the potential to provide accurate real-time predictions (r = 0.903, mSE = 0.109)."
